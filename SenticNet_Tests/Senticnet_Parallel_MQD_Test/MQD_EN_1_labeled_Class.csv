"I'm alone even though I'm married, but it has been long that this weading isn't more than a signed paper, love was gone together with respect and trust, all that is left is self indulgence, the sadness and the lack of trust from my wife.",1

"Like, last week I did her hair, because I do a salon course, so I have to train, but of course a brush and a hair straightener, I know how to do perfectly.",1
"Then I did her hair, did na outward hair straightener, to match the hair, and so she came by saying that it was horrible and ordered me to do everything again, but inward.",-1
"When it was last week, she asked me to do her hair again, and so I did, outwards and stuff.",-1
"And then she came in saying it was horrible, that I didn't know how to do anything right, that my course is worth nothing, and that the other people can do better than me.",-1
"That hurt me you know, imagine, it would hurt anyone, right?",-1
"And when was today, we were at the living room me, my mom and my dad, then my mom said that I never do anything for her, was never in a goodwill to give opinions about her hair and stuff.",-1
"And so I told my dad, what she said to me that day, she said that it was a lie, that I'm a liar and she didn't say any of that.",-1
"Dude, honestly, that makes me furious with her.",1
Why does she lies like this?,-1
"And it wasn't the first time, she always lies.",-1
"She tells me stuff and later says that she didn't, calls me a liar.",-1
I like her a lot and I know that she loves me.,1
"My grandma passed away, I am not being able to deal with this situation.",1
"I'm afraid of falling in depression once again, my heart is like a big emptiness, I try to do everything to fill out my mind, spend my time and nothing conforts me, nothing makes me remove the image of her last breath out of my mind.",-1
"I Love you grandma, continue to take care of me from wherever you are, thank you for the amazing grandma you were with me, for every love gesture and smile.",1
"You were, is, and always will be my warrior, you maam didn't lose to cancer, but cancer lost to you my warrior.",-1
"You maam even played, made us smile and everytime someone said, how is miss Maria?",1
"You maam always replied, I'm good Thank God, what a warrior woman you were grandma, I love you so.",1
"How paintful it is missing you, everyday when I wake up I grab my phone wanting to call you maam to know how you are, I think I wasn't able to discern that yet.",1
"I Love you and every gesture of you will be here inside my heart to remember your love for us, I love you.",1
I'm going to miss you are a piece of me that's going to lack.,-1
Why do I feel so bad and negative?,-1
"I went to the doctor and he said all these pain that I am feeling are caused by nervousness, and how will I stay calm?",-1
"Not everything went so wrong how it is now, but I STILL believe that this year will be good.",1
"Dude, I don't even cry sometimes without realizing and bite my mouth to not collapse in front of someone.",1
"Hearing trash from my father and seeing my mom proposing ridiculous things make me feel worse, more nervous.",-1
"More useless pain, no pain that helps me grow up or mature.",1
I just want my life back and I want all of this to end.,1
My imunity can't endure this anymore.,-1
"I went to the gym today, like promised.",1
"It was full today and this is a pain, takes more time.",1
"I met a new girl there, I think we will be friends.",1
"But something funny happened, since the first day actually.",1
"It's my instructor, like he keeps licking my boots dude, from the moment I arrive until I leave.",1
"On the other times it was like this as well, but now it's too much.",-1
"And I am a person that doesn't realize someone has interest in me, but in this case I'm suspicious of it.",-1
"Today I got there like at 7 hours, he came smiley and said what I had to do, and from machine to machine he came and said something.",1
"On the last machine he standed next to me and I said I was tired, then he said: ""If you want to you can stay there, until 10 pm, when we close the gym.",-1
"And worst is there's only him at the time I go, and I ",-1
"By the time I left, he gave me a chocolate, love senerade.",1
"But, I didn't scoot over him no, even because he didn't ask me for anything, only trated me like that, licking my boots.",1
"I'm going dinner, stay with the most beautiful boy in the world.",1
Well today me and my friends had the ideia to do the Pen Game.,1
Maybe the way that me and my friends are doing might be wrong but it seems real.,1
Well my name is Daniele Felix I Am 15 years and I don't have someone to let off steam so I chose here.,1
I am upset with everything that is happening to me.,-1
A few months ago I met again a friend and he started telling me stuff and I was believing he said so many beautiful things.,1
I was very sad because I really liked him and was willing to do everything for him and then tears fell without control and so I told my friend everything and she is helping me a lot.,1
But he left me as a second choice.,1
"I went to a barbecue at a friend's house, and I met, Carol is her name, later I found out it was Jessica but it's fine.",1
"I hooked up with her and then we went to a motel, on this day I joked with her saying that she would fall in love with me.",1
"I must confess that I really liked hooking up with her, it was very good, but I left thinking she wouldn't want to see me other times.",-1
"After some time, we ended up seeing each other again and we hooked up more.",1
"But there is something in her that bothered me a lot, her way of living life, it was vulgar, thought only in parties, going out drinking, making out, like it was in first place in her goals.",-1
"But now before finishing, I am feeling weird, I think I ended up liking her, the way she takes care of me, of wanting me to always be with her, the she feels jealous, and of always wanting me near her, of always saying that she misses me, of she doesn't mind spending the days off with me locked in a room talking, I'm going to miss her.",-1
"On this moment I'm avoiding her, and it's giving me a tough time, in the heart, but I have to do it, there's no way of continuing, and I am very jealous and intolerant with this type of thing, there is no way of me and her working out.",1
"I'm going to miss her, but life is like this, sometimes you have to let go of some things, so we can keep going our path.",1
"Lately I've been very compulsive - for masturbation with a vibrator, for food, kind of agressive, shaking myself up, biting myself, teasing myself.",-1
"It wasn't really a fuck, but it was cool.",1
"And we had sex twice more at a hotel - I didn't reach orgasm, to tell you the truth my dildo gives me more pleasure, but anyway, I accept everything that gives me pleasure.",1
"In the last psychiatric session, he wanted to give me a neuroleptic (I quickly refused, I'm out of gaining weight) and when I return he suggested a humor stabilizer.",1
"He kind of suggested that I have borderline personality and bipolar spectrum (cyclothymia) anyway, nothing that I wasn't suspecting.",-1
I didn't accept the stabilizer for the same reason as the risperidone.,-1
"I'm as fat as whale, I don't want to get more fat and that's it.",-1
Then he found me better and put on the prescription only a pill of fluoxetine.,1
It's right that staying with these hypomanic crises is kind of emberasing - but being depressed and suicidal ideations isn't cool as well.,-1
I've been very stressed lately.,-1
I had na argument with my mom because of the notebook that she didn't want to borrow me to do the job and I burned myself with the candle.,1
I got a new notebook.,1
"I had a crying crisis while I had sex with my boyfriend, accusing him of not loving me, of treating me like an object e and for him to not touch me anymore.",-1
He wanted to have anal sex with me and was persisting a lot.,-1
"Ok, I overreacted, it didn't need to be like this.",1
"After he told me I value and devalue him very fast, that I constantly change humor, an hour I'm sad the other I'm super happy and asked me if I have some kind of personality disorder or humor.",1
I'm writing disconnected words because my mind is disconnected.,-1
My thought is confused and disorganized.,-1
"Yes, that emberasses me, I like being under control.",1
I'm the one in charge when it's sex time.,-1
"I get on top of him, I ride, I say I payed the motel for an hour and a half and I want to have sex until an hour and a half.",1
Finally on vacations.,1
"Well, my psychiatrist wanted me to try and stay only with a pill of fluoxetine.",0
It didn't took even 2 weeks and I didn't take it and asked him to go back to the previous dosage - 2 pills.,-1
"I was all the time like 'I want to kill myself, kill myself' wasn't sleeping, loud agony and anxiety, crying for any small thing.",-1
Lately my sex instincts and aggressivity have been very outcroped. ,-1
And I think I'm getting addicted to watching pornography on the internet.,-1
"Well, I can't stand this anxiety anymore.",-1
And I've became particularly interested in sadomasochism scenes,1
"At the same time they make me feel good, but at the same time they make me feel bad.",-1
I start to remember my agressions and humiliation and I get bad.,1
"I don't know, it's something so weird.",-1
"And I keep feeling myself like I was any tart, like them - who I am to call someone a tart anyway?",-1
"And the groans are so forced, it looks more like that they are giving birth than having sex - not sex, more like copulation.",-1
"But anyway, sex is sex, and that it relaxes me.",1
"I don't want to become a whale, I'm already too fat !",-1
At least pornography doesn't fatten.,1
I can't stand staying away from my boyfriend - I want to have fucking sex!,1
He travelled and I am here at,1
Now he is on trying to control me.,1
I had another fase of changing of humor in front of him and he threated to break up with me if I didn't take the humour stabilizers.,-1
"Well, I've been searching and the cooler I found was lamotrigine, that doesn't fattening.",1
"Topiramate slims down, but fucks the memory up, and to a college student that is not cool at all.",1
"Well, I still don't know if I'll take it.",0
I'm afraid of transforming into a robot.,-1
Today my class went to the library after the recess.,1
"At recess time I was there looking at the books, to see which I would choose, didn't find any interesting one.",1
"There was one there ""Biloca's Diary"" it is a small book and short little book.",-1
There are not so many pages and the writer wasn't known by me as well!,1
"I took it thinking it would be one of those child books that say: ""Dear diary... Today I learned how to read... """,1
Biluca is not a very well known name.,-1
"So, I didn't have time to read even one page of the book and already striked.",-1
I went to he clarssroom and a little later my teacher took us to the library.,1
I rented the book and left.,-1
When the librarian went to give the book almost dies of shame for taking that book.,1
But I ended up reading it and was very interested on it.,1
I've already read half of the book and I could see that it's completely different from what I thought.,1
Talk about na almost teenager (almost because she is still graduating and stuff) my God.,1
"The discovery of new feelings, new actios and stuff.",1
"When I read the rest of the book, I won't evev lose the chance to do the summary.",1
"Mom, I'm sorry for being who I am, for me being so and solely me, for me being so ""different"", ",-1
"I'm sorry, or better, forgive for me not being the daughter of your so perfect dreams, for me only letting you down when you hoped for the maximum of me.",1
But for me is so hard to manage to please you.,-1
"Quite the opposite, I love you so much!",-1
"I love you more than myself, afterall you are my mom!",1
"Hate, I don't have for you, neither for my father even though he is absent.",1
"Hate I have for myself, for not being the daughter you always wanted and wished: and even though I try - yes, I try.",1
Forgive for me not growing up the manner neither the way you expected.,1
But you don't know how it hurts when you disapprove everything I do for you.,-1
Don't know how it hurts me when you dissaprove me and humiliate me in front of whoever it may be.,-1
"I just wanted to be a reason to be proud, but it looks like I really will never be good enough for you, and I can't pretend anymore that everything is fine, because it's not!",1
"I'm sorry, but I'll never be perfect and that, believe me, hurts more in me than in you.",-1
"I can't stand our fights anymore, they leave me in a state where I can't even explain in words.",-1
"And nothing will change the things you told me, nothing wil make 'us' work out again.",-1
"But mom, please, don't give me up like that.",1
"I can't believe that it is so hard speaking to you, with my own mother.",-1
"Yesterday [Sunday] you couldn't write here because you were too ""busy"".",-1
I left on Saturday to my cousin's bridal shower that will soon get married.,1
"It was me, my sister, boyfriend, father and mother.",0
My boyfriend slept at my house.,0
"I share my bedroom with my sister, so it was me on my bed, he on a mattress on the floor (on the ground next to me) and my sister on her bed that is right beside (very close).",1
"We arrived from the party and went straight to ""sleep"", my sister was the first one to fall asleep, while me and my boyfriend were holding hands (both of us laying down... and talking very low). ",1
Suddenly my sister raises her head and starts crying like crazy.,-1
"At the end, she ended up going to sleep with my dad, and my mom on her bed(my sister's).",1
"My mom is very cool, has the way of a teenager and the mind of a woman.. Is always in good mood, when we go to parties she dances, stirs up, infects everyone.",1
"Her relationship with my boyfriend is great, both play and I love that.",1
"Then he hugged me, kissed me and we were curling up and talking a little and then we slept.",1
"I am very cold sensitive, when I was on my bed, I took 3 blankets and was with a coat.",1
He just hugged me and I started feeling hot and removed my coat.,1
"When I woke up, my boyfriend was with his hand on my waist, hugging me, and with his head near my hair.",-1
"Says him that he got up before me, and kept kissing my face, and I was so sleepy that I didn't even flinch.",1
We got up and went to buy beer for my mom.,1
"After a while, we layed in the sofa (it was already late) because he wanted to watch the game that was going to show on the TV.",1
"When I woke up he huged me, kissed me calling me lazy and said ""I love you"". He's so gorgeous.",1
"We stayed cuddling for the rest of the day, we agreed to go to the mall so he could pay a bill, but who told you laziness let us do it?",-1
"So this is it, I'm done here, today I'm very happy and I already miss him, we are clingy in our own way, and I love that.",1
It's great to have someone that you love by your side.,1
"Not to say that waking up with I love you, makes the day wonderful and happy.",1
"Anyway, Good Night, and I would like to thank the comments on the previous subject.",1
"Well it all started in last year's April when my mother started dating a man that I don't even know where he came from, well they were dating for a week and he was already living in my house.",0
"On his birthday I saw him hiding drugs in my bedroom, and I went there and told my mom.",-1
They argued and she broke up with him.,-1
"But then at 5 am I woke up with my mother screaming and asking for help, he had entered the house and was trying to kill her.",1
"It was not enough to have a burglar in my house, he wouldn't let my mom talk to me and he wouldn't let go of her.",1
"And in this song he starts saying some things about love, and I just think everything he says is beautiful!",1
"A feeling of failure took over me, sadness, discouragement and a total dismay for life.",-1
"I feel my life is so messy, I see my dreams dying, my life taking a direction opposite from what I once imagined.",-1
Why can I never feel complete?,-1
Today my heart is torn apart.,-1
"I arrived at work today so discouraged, I see so much to do but I have no incentive, I get angry when I think that I try so hard to give the best of myself in this company and people indirectly interfere with my work.",-1
"At home things are from bad to worse, the situation of my brother and my sister-in-law drags on, causing enormous suffering for my family.",1
I keep thinking what they are waiting to break up and end this suffering once and for all.,-1
"The way I still think about him is weird, I want to call him.",1
"I was very childish, what's worse is that I continue to be, I'm not a little girl anymore, I'm a woman, there are things that I can't avoid.",-1
"I see a lot of girls suffering for little boys that don't give a shit about them, so to win their attention they pretend to be something they are not.",-1
"I think that is ridiculous, understand that if he doesn't like you now, it doesn't even help daughter, in fact it does, if you have a huuge ass and big boobs, he may then think about being interested in you.",1
"But it's also no use wanting to wear a cleavage, and shorts tucked up your ass, girls like that are only seen as a sexual object.",-1
"Well I did a survey with some boys e they told me that girls who speak slang is normal, but talking to much slang is strange.",-1
"The thing is not being behind him, I know it's hard not to show what you feel, but you can be sure, they don't give so much value to girls who stay behind them, bothering them all time.",1
"If he starts the conversation it means that he likes talking to you, but if you start the conversation, and he replies with short sentences or takes a long time to answer and comes with excuses to say he's sorry for the delay, it means that you are pissing him off and he is only answering you to be polite.",-1
"Before sending it, first see how the course was between the two on that day.",0
"When you see him give him some glances, (but don't hide it) at first he won't understand it, but stare at him for 1 second, and then gently move your hair looking somewhere else.",-1
This way he will try to know what you want.,0
"A lot of girls want to get attention from boys, laughing out loud or talking loudly, but those are things for little girls withou attitude, and you don't want to be seen like that right?",-1
"Post detached girl's sentences, who doesn't need any man to be happy.",-1
"When the phone rings, my hearts races.",1
Loving you when watching the sunrise in the morning.,1
"But you know, it's strange to think that this is natural, I feel completely bad for him showing interest in other women, I consider it disrespectful.",-1
"Looking surreptitiously at a beautiful woman is natural, what woman doesn't know that a handsome man has passed her by too?",1
"But the point is, showing interest for someone else, deliberately showing that you are noticing, facing?",1
"Saying that life is full of choices, is extremely easy.",1
Making the right choices is the hard part.,1
"At 27 years old, I imagine myself still studying something that interests me, if I need to study it all over again, I imagine myself with a straw of respect in my hand, I imagine myself having gone through the best and funniest things in life.",1
I imagine myself visiting my family on the weekends e listening to the rubish my dad says and will always say.,1
"I imagine myself thinking about children, afer all I have a drea: to adopt.",1
I imagine myself passing near my parents' house and leaving a warm bread in the afternoon.,1
"I imagine myself at peace with myself, with everything I've done in my life.",1
"I never gotten ready so quickly, I'm glad I live a five-minutes ride from work.",1
Today my friend (Luciano) made me a fool.,1
"Near our school there's a health center and I asked him to go there and get condoms for me, because even though I'm a girl i think that's good to keep some in case I have sex with someone to have a condom and be protected.",-1
I had to go to the lottery shops to pay some bills (as always I leave everything until the last minute) and the line seemed like a snail to me.,-1
"After an hour I got it, catched the bus and a horrible traffic jam.",-1
"In my birthday I worked all day, almost 8:00 pm and I'm here in this horrible traffic jam, I'm going to get home just to sleep and today is my day I didn't enjoy anything.",1
"It was perfect, my sister and my husband made everything, 2 types of pies, everything was beautiful.",1
Thank God for my husband's life!,1
"That way, you kissing hot and doing everything that can be done inside four walls.",1
Today me and my boyfriend had so much fun.,1
"We were at the bus stop, playing just like in the films, he ran after mim, grabbed me by my waiste, tickled me, putted me in his lap, lifted me taking my feet of the groud.",-1
It was so good for a moment forgetting all my problems.,-1
"I went on a Saturday to the saloon to make a Brazillian Blowout, finally a good hair and not bad hair, I wasn’t enduring that scraggly hair.",1
"Always at night I’m afraid, frightened and I can’t sleep in the dark here there’s a small light that stays lit, at my wedding night I want to do it in clarity.",-1
"Today I went to sleep at 9 in the morning, because I went to sleep in my boyfriends house withouy my parents knowing.",1
I had to go back home earlier like if I had gone to a night club but in the end nothing happened.,1
I had to go back home earlier like if I had gone to a night club but in the end nothing happened.,1
I took Advantage that I had already woken up and called my boyfriend because we were going to see eachother again.,-1
I ended up meeting someone that I love and she loves me too.,1
"I am seriously thinking in running away from home and giving it some time, and in sequence living with my loved one!",1
I thought that I would never love anyone in my life and this happens now that after I'm old.,1
Oh my God I'm so ansious I imagine all the time me and my loved one together.,1
"My husband in 10 years can't put anything inside the house de bills are late the fridge empty, he is lazy.",-1
"I recorded a movie on the TV, and now appetized me going watch it.",0
"His story talks about three chubby friends, that one day, get tired of how they are, get tired of the dirty looks of other people, get tired of not being able of doing things other woman do, get tired of being ""puffy"".",-1
"So, they decided to make a pact, Cinderella's pact, where they promise each other that will do anything to lose weight.",1
"And they do it, lose weight and become woman with a perfectly normal weight, and much prettier!",1
"But this, from now on will change, because from now on I'll pledge myself to the maximum, and I'll manage to make a healthy died to lose weight.",1
"And I'll prove to everyone that, just like every other girl, I too can have an athletic body and be very thin and perfect.",1
"Because I will be able to lose weight, and I'll prove to everyone that I'm not just any fat girl.",1
"We already went out, and this is the third time to which I will report.",1
We had already scheduled by cellphone on Sunday.,1
Monday there would be a hot sex in bed.,1
"Well, we work in the same company, however, in different sectors, she blond, long hair, she is delicious.",1
We scheduled and there he was waiting for me on the parking lot.,1
"We left and went in ""working hours"" to a motel called Beira Rio, near our work.",1
"Arriving there we went to a stand suite, super confortable and there it started, hot kisses alla round and I soon realized that she was super hot.",1
"I removed my pants and was only with my box underwearand a black regatta, she went to the bathroom and when she came back with a killer red bikini panties.",-1
She sat on me and rubbed hot on me.,1
"However, being alone is absolutely the opposite of being with someone.",-1
Being alone is closing your hands out of nowhere when you cross the street running and you don't have a hand to hold.,-1
"Being alone is sad, gets in other people's nerves and probably is not good for health.",-1
I found I with my mom that my step father was cheating on her.,1
I found out as well that he was cheating on her with my aunt.,1
And on top of that he hit my mom.,1
He threatened me that would kill me.,-1
"I still couldn't stop cutting myself, I know this is a problem and stuff but c'mon it's hard.",-1
"Sometimes comes to my mind that no ones likes me, my mom is a pain in the ass the only one that saves himself that I haven't done any silliness yet is still Vinny.",1
"Sometimes I feel sad, I'm 12 years old and I've never kissed, most of my friends, have already tongue kissed, and worst is I think I'm ugly.",-1
I've never loved someone how I loved you.,-1
We are living in a world where physical appearance is worth more then internal appearance.,1
"Before doing the History test, we prayed this prayer and I pray until this day it has already been 3 years since I last saw the teacher that thought us this prayer but I really like her.",1
True friendships that is what the world needs.,-1
Today was a day with so many surprises and joy I still don't know exactly how to say is that I still can't believe that I'm awake at 5 am thinking about him.,1
He told me that he loved me that misses me that when finished college would come to get me.,-1
"I came here after the light returned, I kept looking at his picture that I have.",1
And I don't know what I'm feeling now but I feel calm happy but I don't know.,-1
He completes me when you feel that something is missing on you but you never knew what it was and then you find someone that understands you and every kind of opposite and then you feel complete.,1
"Look I'm not very tall, but enough for my age and I'm under the ideal weight.",1
"Always when you do those tracking down at school, I'm always on alert because I'm under and I don't like that.",-1
"When I try to alert people closer to me they say oh you are skinny you need to gain weight and stuff, but when I try to joke about the situation to alert them say oh but you are not so tall.",-1
And then boys also like girls that have some body. Not the ones that seem to have only bones.,-1
I have no brothers and for many reasons i learned that my best friends don't know how to keep secrets.,1
"I make it look like I have a very happy air, because I learned that crying doesn't solve anything and that ended up making everybody trust me stuff, because they know I'm very positive and security.",1
"Who already dated and never missed their ex, throw the first stone.",1
"When we are in love, inside us a confusion of feelings that we get lost.",-1
"I dated a boy called Luan, he is 3 months younger than me, and maybe my mistake was already starting like this, because the woman matures before the man.",1
"But we had a perfect relationship, one to make others envy..",1
His friends started to hate me because he only wanted to be with me.,1
"We only cared about our opinions, and we dated for 9 months.",1
"On a certain day, we fought and I couldn't take it and broke up",-1
"After that we hooked up every once in a while, hidden, so that no one would disturb us.",-1
"But I couldn't take it, being treated like a friend in front of other so that later when we were alone we would have any kind of touch.",1
"Pay attention boy, she laughs at your most stupid jokes.",-1
She interests herself by all you nonsense matters.,1
"So, she is there to take you talking about banal stuff, she just wants to see your mouth moving and the sound of your mouth leaving.",-1
"She doesn't care of listening to your love reclamations, even though it hurts a lot, she'll always be there, to support you.",1
She only cares about seing you well.,1
"When she gets on your nerves, don't fight, she just likes seing you a little mad, because she knows that after you'll show a smile, and she loves that smile.",1
"I see that I'm surrounded by fake people, dirty lying man that when I think I found someone different, it's a mistake, it's only another fake and liar.",-1
"I'll learn to live witouht you, and if God wants I'll also be happy.",1
I will always remind me of you with care of everything that I lived with you. ,1
"Zootechnicians are professional responsible by the study and control of reproduction, genetic upgrading and nutrition of animals created with commercials purposes, and want to increase the production and upgrade the quality of animal origin products.",1
"They carry out experiments with food and search ways to guarantee the hygiene conditions and to prevent and fight diseases and parasytes, to improve flock's lives and the quality of the derivatived products.",1
They also work as rural administrators and farm and rural facilities planners.,1
Eggs without cholesterol and light pork meat are examples of what genetic research can do looking for healthier foods.,1
"Many times confused with the vet, the zootechnician is, actually, the professional oriented to the production development.",1
"You travelled, you are far from me.",1
I can't stop thinking about you.,1
"Because, I don't know if I'll take it from missing you.",-1
"Oh! My honey, you are my other half.",1
"I kill time, writing in this online diary.",-1
I'm ansious to wait you.,-1
Only you make me smile.,1
I want soon your strong hug.,1
"Maybe it's only me, that never had a cute and perfect boyfriend for even a month?",-1
In my love life everything is a BIG shit.,1
"When the guy is interested in me sometimes I'm not interested on the guy or everyone is interested and it doesn't work out, something happens and that's it.",-1
"I know I have to wait, but I waited too much.",-1
"This is the first record that I do here, and in the moment there is not much to talk about my personal life, so, I'll reproduce something I wrote in message.",1
"Stay there that I stay here with my boobs, with hard and salient tips, crazy to be licked from top to bottom, from side to side, being slightly bitten and completely sucked. ",1
"Tips that can be as soft as the boobs, that are swollen and proud of being so cute.",1
"These boobs that don't fit inside a hand, that sprawl between fingers, that hopes that squeeze them firmly, fingers that go inside the bra, appearing from the malicious cleavage of the red shirt, and inside the bra squeeze them with sweetness, delicately, touching and pulling out everything that from inside burns and strongly beats.",-1
"Smooth mouth, greedy, hot, that will try to swallow him completely and won't be able to, will lick it completely to compensate the fact that he can't touch it entirely with the mouth.",1
"The hands surrounding it while the mouth won't stop licking it like it was ice cream, because they almost melt on the mouth.",-1
"And those tips get even harder, provoking an impatient excitement, kind of nervous, getting wet of so nervous.",-1
"My heart races, my hands get cold and a little trembling, it gives me butterflies in my stomach, and a strange feeling when he's around, and especially when we are alone, or even in a crowd, when he hugs me and says: ""I look gorgeous today"".",1
"At this moment I'm embarassed, and shyness takes over me and when I realize, I'm already in his arms.",-1
"I already totally forget where I am, and I stop caring about the people around me, when I'm with him, it's like there's just the two of us there.",-1
I think that living a romance is much cooler than just an affair.,1
"A romance is for indefinitely time, while an affair has it's days numbered.",-1
"I'm liking to love, and to be loved, the best thing there is is having good feelings matched.",1
"May it be eternal while it lasts, and may it last forever.",1
"I'M COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH YOU, I WISH YOU ALL THE GOOD FEELINGS, ALL THE GOOD COMPANIES.",1
"MAY THE LOVE OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE WILLINGNESS OF KNOWLEDGE BE YOUR ""LITTLE MARK"" IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ILLUMINATED SPIRIT.",1
"MAY YOU BRING WITH YOU LOVE, WISDOM, PEACE, CALM AND THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE.",1
"MAY YOU TEACH ME HOW TO BE MORE HUMAN AND THE TRUE MEANING OF LOVE, FROM NOW ON FORGIVE ME FOR MY EXCESSES TOWARDS YOU, BUT MAY THIS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY BE UTILISED AND MAY GOD HELP US DAILY TO BE ""MOTHER AND SON"" MAY YOU COME MY BELOVED SON.",1
"I remember so many moments, so many good things that we did together, you were an angel to me.",1
"I don't even remember exactly how I met you but I know that it was the best day of my life, you are more than a friend to me, you are a sister from a different family.",1
You don't even know how bad I felt about you changing schools.,-1
I want you to do well in life and love someone who also loves you very much.,1
We are starting to drift apart and you haven't even noticed.,-1
"But know that I still miss you so much, I miss your smile.",-1
"Dude, I can't stand Douglas anymore, what a boring boy!",-1
"Like, he had disappeared, now he is back to bug me again.",-1
"I don't treat him badly, but man he just talks shit, I already said I don't want to be with him anymore, but he insists in a way that suffocates me.",-1
"I would really want to have his friendship, but he always comes with second intentions, I'm almost putting an end to this, in other words, excluding him.",1
"And so, he gives me so much DISGUST, that I don't even understand why.",-1
"He stuck his tongue down my throat, I almost died.",-1
"Just imagining us making out, makes me want to throw up.",1
Today I went out with some friends.,1
"I love them because they are very nice and funny, we love to laugh and play games.",1
"On the way to this girl's house we found a gentleman laying on the floor as if he were dead or passed out, what's strange is that the man had his eyes half open and turned upwards.",1
"I found super weird and i was very scared, even though we passed by the man and kept walking.",-1
"My girl senses were telling me something was wrong, so I asked Lucas and Victor to go back there with me and try waking up the man to know if he was alive.",1
"But I wanted to go back there anyway, so we went back.",1
"The boys were trying to wake the man up in every way but he just woudln't wake up, so I decided to wake him up myself.",1
"I moved him, rocked him, turned him over e he woudln't wake up, until I saw a bottle near his head and I decided to pick it up and pour the liquid inside it in the man's head, that's when he woke up.",1
My mom and I had a big argue because of sleep time.,1
"Then the crybaby here spent the night crying, until here eyes were swollen.",-1
"Thinking that the only way that my parents won't argue with me would only be dying, then I wouldn't bother anyone.",1
I took one more antidepressant pill (usually I take only two) and went to listen to music.,1
"After some time, I was happily dancing, like nothing happened.",1
"And it was like that unitl 5 am, when I finally decided to sleep.",1
"And no, it wasn't the medicine, because he takes to long to work, it's lot like that from a moment to another.",1
"Well, what matters is that I'm better.",1
Today I schedule an appointment with the gynaecologist.,0
"We never had sex, but I think it's closer than far.",-1
"I'm a virgin, or at least we've never had penetration.",1
"The only thing we've ever done was oral sex, he on me.",1
"Sometimes I feel kind of bad for being so dependent of other, not knowing how to do anything alone.",-1
"I get jealous of my friends that can solve everything, know how to go everywhere, and doing fine.",1
The college schedule were terrible.,-1
"She keeps rubbing in my face that I can't do anything, and then I stay with that in my head, and it makes even more powerless.",-1
I argued with him and I erased everything but on the following week I saw more and more porn drawing.,-1
"Oh guys I don't like this, I don't know I think it's a lot of disrespect with me!",-1
But she is very special she is my best friend.,1
"With the end of the college semester, I was terrible.",-1
"It was seminar, test and tasks everything together, I was getting actually getting crazy, even more me, who hates speaking in public.",-1
"I have actually no way, stutter, forget, like hell.",-1
"There was a subject that I reached the limit of absences: another that I scraped through: there was a task I didn't even see the colour, but put my name: on the seminars I was saved by the others.",1
"There was one that I gave up on the last minute and started crying, but I spoke to the teacher and she gave me an enormous alternative task, so that I wouldn't have a zero.",1
I feel super bad that everyone presents well and I present bad.,1
"Because it's public, the level is very high.",-1
And my complex of inferiority only gets higher on these situations.,1
My psychologist asked me if I wanted a second opinion (not only about the medicine matter but to really see if I have BPD- borderline personality) and I agreed.,1
I went to the psychiatrist and she gave me risperidone.,0
"I decided to accept, because I was really terrible (I still am, but al least now that I'm on vacation I could take a break).",-1
"I was always perfectionistic, I always like giving my best, mainly on the matter intelectual performance.",1
I want to compensate what my colleagues from college did for me.,1
"In a little while no one will want to call me to the groups, if I continue bad like this.",-1
"I want to drive a car, be independant, be a successful pyschologist.",1
At least the college subjects will be cooler and more related to the course.,1
"On Saturday, July 28th, it was a wonderful Saturday.",1
"I met a guy, kind, handsome and funny.",1
"Maybe I met him two or more weeks ago, I don't remember.",-1
But I perfectly remember that he told me that he liked me a lot.,1
I wasn't surprised and nothing to brag about.,-1
I was already used to knowing that a lot of boys declared to me.,-1
Worst is I liked him too.,-1
"You may think I'm crazy, I really liked a boy I met on the internet.",-1
"I'm already tired of running behind who doesn't deserve me, now if you want you come to me, you know where to find me and where to look for.",-1
"They don't think like girls. So, don't treat them as ""friends"".",-1
"Man are naturally territorial, they are jealous and hunters!",1
"It was just a wink, that I fell in love anyways, and in the middle of the smoke, and also liked me.",1
Yes I am a preppy !,1
"Yes I am a proud, I don't hook up with everyone (particularly because that's a bitch thing), play football, speak with who speaks to me, and I'm not of having many friends!",1
In my school is full of rockers and the preppys that were there normally became bitches!,1
"I am one of the few respectable preppy, that enjoy reading and who are not examples of bitches.",1
"Last carnival there was a celebration at the school, every class were gathered, I prefered to read a book at the library, there was the music teacher and about three rockers students as well.",1
"I entered, excused me and went to grab a romance book!",1
There was a boy that kept looking at me and that was bothering me.,-1
I don't consider myself a lucky person.,-1
Neither consider myself a person with feelings.,-1
"But, the bigger of them, is hate.",-1
"Many think that I'm wrong, and that I'm saying countless silly things, when I say there is a great hate inside me.",-1
"But these people are only countless mortals that say what it comes to mind, literally, they know nothing about me, and much less, about what I think.",-1
"Not that I consider myself imortal, to me, everyone has the same destiny.",1
"But lately, some weird things have been happening to me.",-1
My family never cared about what happened to me or what didn't happen to me.,1
"By the way no one never cared in at least knowing if I was fine, or was needing help.",-1
No one never cared about me.,-1
"Love letters generally don't start like this, with explanations and reasons.",1
But there wouldn't be another way of writing something that I feel without trying to explain or give reasons even that loving exempt any kind of explanation and don't need reasons to happen.,1
"I think that love arises from I don't know where, grows I don't know why and hurts you not on purpose maybe you are my only hope... or the last.",1
"Not because I can't fall in love again but because everytime that I want wish for a person, this person will be you!",1
That will be on my dreams you are different!,-1
"Is the only responsible for what I feel I give myself completely to you, if you want this way I can give your name to some star or give this star to you.",1
"I can try to stop the wind or sit on spring's breeze I can try stop the sun or make you have a perfect day I can try and do so many things for you, less that you love me as much as I LOVE YOU.",1
"Well if loving is thinking about you 24 hours a day, leaving to the street thinking that I can come across you at any moment and close my eyes and see your face, it may even be love!",1
And everyday I'll look at the sky and will appreciate for having founf you and for being more than I expected I'll appreciate your glance.,1
"On this terrible state of depression that I found myself, I didn't know anymore what to do because of so much despair, I felt a inconsolable ",-1
"I found a solution, or better, in my head it was the only solution.",1
I started cutting my wrists in order to bring back physical pain and forget the emocional pain.,-1
Amazingly that made me stronger.,1
"My friend Laura, the dumbest of them all started cutting herself in the middle of the classroom.",-1
"FUCKING AGAIN, she was called to the principal's office, she gave the names of everyone who was in the game, and they were all called, one by one as if they were at a police station.",-1
"Then they found out that all of us had cut ourselves, they thought we had made some kind of pact.. they called our parents, but only Laura's and my mother showed up and found out.",1
"My weekend was okay, let's just say I expected a little bit more.",1
"Last night my boyfriend came by, we didn't go out, we just stayed at home.",-1
And as always there was another argument about our relationship.,-1
"But this time it was kind of nice, we talked a lot, I think he understood my side.",1
In fact I think I managed to express clearly what I was feeling.,1
"It was cool, after a lot of talking we ended up dating, it's incredible how that boy has the gift to make me crazy and make me happy at the same time.",1
The moments by your side are always perfect you know.,1
"When you kiss me it's like millions of lights shining in my world, I fell myself floating in your arms.",1
When you hug me I feel protected.,1
As if any problem could affect us!,-1
I'm sure this is called LOVE.,1
And it's incredible how this feeling makes me feel good and bad at the same time.,1
"Today I felt very lonely and instead of crying, as usual, I self-harmed myself.",-1
"I hit myself very much, and I bit myself 3 times.",-1
"I don't recomend this to anybody, but I can't think of other things to do when sad, because my friends and family don't understand that I get sad without a reason and will call me a beast and if I tell someone I self-harmed myself they will call me sick, because this is what humans do, judges one another.",-1
Life was given for us for free.,1
The power of reaction is inside each and everyone of us.,1
To be happy there is no magic potion.,1
It is only needed having a clean soul and bereft of suffering and rancour.,1
Everyone is free to fulfil your mission the way you wish.,1
"Happines is always knocking at our door, just open it and invite her in.",1
We will always have enlightened souls extending their hands to us.,1
"Alive, happy and communicative, these gemini beings, light and carefree, seem to be in good terms with everyone.",1
"Nice as they are, will always give the impression that they are interested in someone, but are only talking and looking for information.",-1
"Gemini are always very expressive and talk a lot with their hands, always telling the fact that happened to them with a lot of vivacity",1
"Your walk is kind of hopping and happy, and always make a lot of stuff at the same time, like study watching TV and speaking on the cellphone while talk to you.",1
In reality it is not a matter that they are following the fashion: they are always on the fashion.,1
"I am very organized, paranoid, I have disgust of almost everything.",1
"I really like children, and sometimes I look a lot like them, I really like to play, jump, anyway... clutter, I really like happy and different stuff.",-1
Truth is I am too much intense and there's no one that can find a way to this.,-1
I vibrate with joy that does not belong to me.,1
"The best of all is that, everynight before I sleep, I pray.",1
And always smile!,1
Missing is the biggest proof that the past was worth it.,-1
"Truthfully, I have no mood to get dressed, to take care of myself, bad thought take over my mind and I enter a state of despair.",1
"I borrowed my dad some money and honestly, I regret that a lot.",1
"Diego sent me away, didn't want to know about me anymore, my mom turned her back to me, I only had my father and him asking me to get money from the bank, doing the biggest psychological pressure, I wouldn't get it?",1
"Well, now is not different, because anyway he is with me for pity.",-1
"Now I am here with all my cards needing to be splitted (I'll pay triple the price because of the interest), withou a cent and on top of that Diego arguing with me and throwing in my face that I borrowed money to my dad.",1
"He doesn't understand because he never had to go through any difficulty like that, but I'm sure that if it was his mom on my dad's place, he would have done the same.",1
"Diego, in turn, instead of being a present boyfriend, that supports me, that advise me and that tries to understand my point and help me, only knows how to judge me and fight me because of that.",1
"Yesterday, I was with my best friend on the classroom, I was late and spoke a little to my best friend.",1
And then that crazy that I told you about that day that I made a fool of myself ant that she didn't let me speak to my best friend.,-1
And then the crazy lady spoke to her and I didn't even understand their conversation nut I ended up being quiet.,-1
The portuguese class was boring.,-1
"Hours were passing by, we went to the video room, it was PE classes, damn it!",-1
I wished I had gone to the court but the teacher wanted us to stay at the video room and watch the boring movie.,-1
"You promised me, I know, I remember, we swore that it would be forever.",1
"You also swore, that you would forgive my mistakes and my flaws, that any slip I had, you would forgive, because of the good I had done to you, would overcome any pain.",1
"Forgive me, I made unforgivable mistakes, just as I have already forgiven, I made exagerated slips, and it wasn't the first time, I lied for fear of your reaction, for fear that you would abandon me, I fought so hard alongside this fear, that nothing helped me, the fear only made me lose you.",-1
"I can't hide the sadness anymore, and the tears took over my eyes.",1
"I have no more floor, I'm so lost, without dreams.",-1
"I find myself empty, without hope and after all I've done for you, without the courage to ask you to be with me.",-1
"I love you so much, I wanted you to know that, that you realize my acts of love, affection, dedication that I showed you.",1
I think of the future because this will be good for me and for everyone I love.,1
"I will graduate, work, I will do what's possible to keep the peace in my house.",1
I don't intend to seriously commit to anyone. ,-1
"Different thoughts, we have different objectives.",-1
"I come from a family where the Father always provided the house to raise the children, while my mother stayed at home taking care of us.",1
"We didn't have everything, but the essentials to make us responsible adults!",1
"I have a lot of friends, I'm an extroverted, happy, I love seeing people happy around me, I value health a lot, because if we have it, we go after the rest.",1
"But my husband is Materialistic, Moody, I say almost BIPOLAR, a good father for sure, but not a good husband.",-1
"Doesn't have many friends, and ends up being selfish many times, if he needs to, he goes over someone to win something.",-1
"For me the simplest things in life are the best, I love visits.",1
And letting someone happy is worth more then knowing my life.,1
"And I'm very happy with the approval, even knowing that it wasn't truly deserved.",1
"But this time things ended up fine, after so much pain and sorrow for the circumstances, everything ended, fine.",1
"And this affected me a lot, I was totally mad.",1
I still remember the sweet words that you used to say.,1
"I remember the smile that you had on your face when you saw me, the explanations that you gave me when you couldn't call me.",1
"I still remember the times that you looked at me and said how much you loved me, how much you wanted me.",1
I still remember the times you looked at me and said that you were affraid of losing me.,-1
I still remember how much satisfection that I had in seeing you smile.,1
"I still remember everything I lived with you, and I miss those nights when you told me your joys and agonies.",-1
"I've been remembering those conversations, those laughs and also our secrets.",1
"I always remember your smile, when I arrived sad, I felt embraced by it.",1
"And I also remember, how you managed to placate my pain.",-1
"What a desire to go back in time, have you by my side, with your enlightened eyes.",1
"I kept all in my memory, I will never forget them.",1
"Our paths changed, but didn't lose one another: I'm still here, and what's best, is that I'm sure you are here as well.",1
"If you need, ask for me: if you miss me, call me: if you have a any problem, count on me: and if you have some time, let's see each other!",1
"I don't have that young look anymore, but my heart is still the same that loved you, that gave you affection, and loved receiving yours.",1
"Maybe we'll see each other tomorrow, maybe we'll only meet in a year, maybe even time will push us further away, but I want you to know that today I remembered you.",1
"I promise to love you till the end of my life, until my last breath, until the last beat of my heart, until the last tear in my face.",1
"Because now I know that you are the one that my heart really chose, that it's for you that I will fight till the end and that I'll wish all the time in all my dreams in all my wishes in all my prayers.",1
"I feel this desire every day you know, even when I do, but hours later I already want to make love with passion.",1
"My guardian angel called Douglas, besides gorgeous he was my best friend!",1
Because friends also say I LOVE YOU!,1
I can't think of him without laughing!,-1
"He called all the boys that I told him I was friend, assholes, he wasn't a boring friend, that stays on my toes, but he never let me do anything wrong!",-1
"He was, and will always be my best friend, because he isn't visible, but he's alive in my heart!",1
"This is a place where a lot of venting takes place and I feel like a ""big mother"" for many that write, because I'm older than most of the girls here.",-1
"Most of those who threaten to do something, don't do it, but if you are thinking, I have a report to give.",1
One coleague of mine killed herself before her 30's!,1
It was a scare for many people.,-1
She divorced her husband and couldn't take it!,-1
At 5 years old I almost died!,-1
I had appendicitis and serious complications.,1
Actualy it's a miracle that I'm alive.,1
And it will be selfish of me to let others sort it out.,-1
I can't see a hot blonde in front of me that I'm already turned on!,1
"So I don't even know what else I to do, hand myself to death or wait a little longer?",-1
Indirects afect my bad humor and just makes you more disgusting to me.,-1
"Me and my boyfriend now, we had spent a lot of time together, and we still have that dream of sleeping together, and wake up next to each other, you know.",1
And still fucks you HARD and after that licks his lips because to show it was good.,1
"It was all so intense, one month looked like years.",1
"After a lot of tears and a farwell party my vacation was over, I went back to my reality and so my summer romance had to end because of the real world responsabilities.",1
I fell like one part of me is somewhere else.,0
Looking foward to a tight hug and a kiss on the forehead.,-1
"My mind says that waiting that much is crazy, but my heart says it's possible.",1
Today I felt a very pleasant nostalgia for everyone and everywhere I stayed.,1
"For almost two months they made me have a routine, very crazy, but a nice routine.",1
I believe that because of that this vacation were perfect.,1
It was a gift from the skies.,1
"Traveling with friends, without any relative near was the best thing I've ever done.",1
I'm really missing this freedom right now.,1
This story tells about the relationship between women.,1
"I woke up late, with that desire to stay on the bed, that desire to do nothing, simply, vegetate!",1
"I hate felling lazy, I keep blaming myself for not enjoying the world when I'm doing nothing, but in the last weeks I really feel like sleeping and forget the world around me.",-1
"The car I would like to buy will have to wait after all I didn't know that stuff for the house was so expensive, everything looked like a dream or rather a nightmare.",1
"Arriving there, Helen received me with a smile, but something in was different in her eyes, then she told me that Erika was there with some friends dismantling the furniture.",-1
As soon as you go up Erika will look at you with those disapproving eyes.,-1
"At nightfall we headed to the closest hotel to the house, with a good apearence, it was more pleasant to spend the night.",1
"We went up the stairs and entered room 42, a mirror in front, wide bathroom with old ceramic, in the bedroom a huge bed, the ambient looked like a Motel, but a little bit less daring.",-1
"She took off her shirt towards the bathroom, I kept looking at her curves, she wasn't thin but wasn't overweight either, when I heard the shower turning on I felt my body warmer, I knew it was the first symptoms that my body gave of excitment.",1

"We woke up very early, went back to her house, soon the truck would arrive to take the change, she had taken on a big responsability.",1
"Seeing all those bags packed, I realized what I was doing and that it really was a madness that I was starting to like.",-1
"I've already loved someone that never loved me, i did everything for my ex, and from one day to another she left me, it hurts so much loving and having to leave from crumbs, and in this short life of mine I've already suffered to much, so why not correspond to Helen.",-1
"Why not make her happy, since she also willing to make me happy.",1
"Now with a more opened heart, I followed the truck towards the new house, after thirty minutes we were close.",1
"Life was cruel to me, since I'm small I've been working as shoe shiner, starving and watching everybody with mom and dad, and I an orphan with living parents.",-1
"I realized that the Sun almost didn't stike, and that the biggest difficulty would be the clothes, I realized that Helen wasn't happy, but I knew that I would help her, my money was almost over, she with a bad name and bogged down with bills couldn't help any soon.",-1

The night was coming when I heard the knock at the door.,0
"Of course, I came back from the trip because I wanted to know how you are, I brought unpleasent news about your aunt.",1
"You will always be that little girl with blonde hair and a smile on the most beautiful face on the world, I love you, don't forget.",1
"I closed the door, Helen looked at me scared, didn't say anything and only adressed to the bathroom, turned on the shower, got in with clothes and everything, the tears got mixed with the shower's water, the door opens.",1
"I can't, my life is over, I don't know what to do.",0
"The following week was raining a lot, I woke frightened during the night, the house was full of water, on the height of the bed.",1
"In a few minutes, Helen came in a way I've never seen before, it was truthful, it was a lot more than simple sex.",1
"After this experience, every time she wanted me to be a man on bed, and I soon started to question why these atitudes.",-1
"Two days after the flood I started having strong muscle pain, and fever wasn't constant, seven days went by, I went to work my eye was huge, I thought I had conjunctivitis, excused me from service, and when I was leaving I had a big surprise, it was my sister looking at me.",1

There I was able to reconnect with my family and get Helena closer too.,1
"I have everything that a little teenager can have, friends, people that love me, ""money"", popularity, I've got everyting.",1
"I don't have the touch of your hand running through my body, I don't have you hugs, I don't have your kisses, I don't have you in my life.",-1
I do everything I can because for my life to be perfect it's just missing you in it.,1

"You know today when I was leaving my home's garage I accidentally slamed the car and scratched it on the back, wow I feel like crap.",1
"And my husband saw it and called my attention and he was right, because I am very distracted and DUMB for doing that and I admit that I am weong and I'm embarrased for doing this.",-1
I know I didn't mean it but I have the obligation to pay a little more attention.,-1
I'm with an imense willness to hit me because of the fury that I am of myself.,-1
Yesterday I had a wonderful night with my husband.,1
It won't will be hard for me to write this guide.,1
"When you fall in love for a shy girl, know that she can also be but will never take the initiative to look in your eyes.",1
"So, you will have to go there and talk to her, anything, normally, say ""Hi"" after ""Is everything alright?"" and start a subject interesting, nothing too personal.",1
"If the both of you end up getting along in the conversation, probably, this will be a signal that she is liking the conversation and is thinking that you are a nice person, that is very important so everything goes alright.",1
"So, in case you guys don't see eachother anymore, call her and invite to go out so you both talk.",1
"She can even stay a little awkward, but, if the conversation of you both was pleasant for her, for sure she will accept the invitation.",1
"Don't stay quiet during the date, you will let her stay quiet too and in case she wants to say something, she can be shy and continue quiet, so, always be talking good subjects.",1
"When you go ask her to be your girlfriend, don't be playful or hard because that won't work with shy girl, be straight, talk to her getting exactly to important point.",1
"After she finally accepts it, all red and with shame, here's the tip, don't let her fell pressured by you, if somebody makes some dull joke that might leave her feeling bad, defend her in the same time, always pull pleasant subjects, I repeat.",-1
"I'm sorry for not taking good care of you, little one.",1
"I thought that some things so banal, were more important.",-1
I'm sorry for making such a big and unforgivable mistake.,-1
"I was so dumb, valuing after losing.",-1
"But I still, know that if I simply went playing with you, like always, you would forget everything, and cheer me up, like you always do.",1
Remember that Christmas that I spent alone?,1
"My dad prefered my step-mom (even though I'm already used to it, it was the first time he had done it).",1
You were there to help me when I needed.,1
"You licked my tears, and slept next to me very time I cried until I fell asleep.",-1
"On Easter, there were we, on the same year, home alone again.",1
"You were always there when I needed, yes, I feel like I should repeat this.",1
"How many people are really worth meeting, and are your true friends?",1
"When my parents divorced, nothing was left to me.",-1
"I think that was already mature for being eight or nine years old, honestly.",1
"Only you knew that I didn't cry for being left alone on those dates we used to celebrate, but I cried because my father was everything that was left to me, and I simply was his second option.",-1
"So, I have you left.",0
"You were simply stolen from me, right?",1
"I knew that you were gone some way, but I wanted to avoid that, I wanted to lie to myself.",-1
"Truth hurts, it always did",1
"After my dad, simply came and said something like ""You heartless, didn't realize that your dog isn't there anymore, that he was stolen?"".",-1
"Even thought, on that time I looked for you.",1
I searched like never.,1
"I looked every where on the backyard, and left with pajamas around the streets of Curitiba looking for you.",0
"At night, I cried.",-1
"I cried more than on Chrismas and on Easter, I swear that I cried.",-1
"I don't know how it was possible, but I cried for six hours without stoping.",-1
"The situation didn't get better my dad see me crying and start to yell ""stop crying, what a childish thing"" and argue with me, scold me of everything.",-1
"I simply thought ""He can't see that I just lost everything that I had?""",1
I felt like the most lost person on the world.,-1
"Dog, thank you for being there when I suffered bullying, and was anorexic because of idiotic and banal coments that wouldn't change my life if I didn't care.",-1
"Thank you for being there when I thought of killing myself, I looked at you, and thought ""I need to stay to take care of you.""",1
"No one believes, and a few even laugh, when I say that my dog was everything and nothind to me, that saved me from suicide, but I think that reading this text, a few would understand.",1
"I still pass every Chrismas from there forward alone, and Easters too.",-1
"No because I want, the whole family simply forgets my existence.",1
"My mom won't even let me go out with her, and takes my sister, and after even complains that is the ""unloved"" of the story.",-1
"Well, these days, I always miss you.",-1
"I regret crying before having you next to me, and now I feel like I have real reasons to be like this.",1
"Thank you for having changed my life, and for saving it.",1
"Sinceraly, without you, I would already be dead.",-1
"That is a phrase I usually tell to someone who asks about my life, but no one understands.",-1
Are few the ones that I explain myself.,1
"It has to be to someone who actually deserves the story, and has patienceto listen to it.",1
"Now I'm sustained by memories, you know?",-1
"Not having you anymore, I think that's what left to me.",0
I can't attach myself to friends that I know that won't be with me like they say they will.,1
"I attach myself to memories because a lot of them don't come back, a lot of people change, but memories don't.",1
"When I looked back, he barked and made a sexy pose that seduced me, I want him.",-1
"I don't know if you remember this, dog, but I dog.",-1
"I don't know if you're alive, but wherever you are, you are in my heart, and I'm with you little guy.",1
"That promised that I made you on that Chrismas, and hugged you tight.",1
"I still have your collar, your food pot, everything that belonged to you.",-1
"I don't dare throw any of that away, because it's what's left me of you, isn't it?",-1
"Maybe I'll donate, to a dog that need's love.",1
It would be evil to lack for one while I have it and won't give because I'm attached to that.,-1
"It' is the heart and the soul, and I know you look at me, little guy.",1
The boyfriend isn't mine.,0
"Well, a long time afo I wanted to let off steam what I THINK about the BOYFRIEND of a FRIEND of mine, one of my CLOSESTS friends.",1
"I've already told her a few things, but it's complicated talking about other people's boyfriend right?",-1
"She dates him for almost 4 years, has already broken up once, but for a short time.",-1
"They live in different cities, but close.",1
And he doesn't care if her parents don't like.,-1
She doesn't care about anything.,-1
"He is 20 years old, hasn't finished high school (BECAUSE OF LAZYNESS), DOESN'T WORK, and is fanatic for gym.",-1
"Everywhere they go, the bill is ALWAYS split, equaliy between both.",1

"She can't leave here without him, only stay at home!",1
"I've never had a long distance relationship, but I think it wouldn't be easy! ",-1
He turns off the cellphone at dawn and on the other day says that the battery died.,1
"Goes out at dawn and says that went to buy ""pastel"".",1
"Is also funny that he almost never has money to spend with the friend, always has to split, but with DESIGNER CLOTHES, SNEAKERS and gym he always has.",1
"Is also funny that he almost never has money to spend with the friend, always has to split, but with DESIGNER CLOTHES, SNEAKERS and gym he always has.",1

"They don't trust each other, she already told me clearly that doesn't trust!",-1
"Yesterday night when I arrived from the course and was going to dinner I felt one of those pain that I always feel on the leg my leg was paralized Fernanda took me to the living room my father was having dinner, when I went to the living room I started shaking and feeling a dizziness and a buzz followed by a dormancy on my hands.",-1
"Nanda called SAMU but it didn't help a lot they couldn't come, but my father took me to a UPA there I was attended fastly the doctor didn't know what I had and prescribed me a medicine for me to stop shaking the medicine was veiny way so I had to take it together with serum on the vein.",1
"Then my panic I couldn't take the medicine I was very nervous and afraid, my dad didn't understand the phobia that I have of needles and argued with me in front of the nurses.",-1
My dad hold me by my arm and wanted to take me to take the medicine at that time I was already having a panic attack and couldn't stop crying and didn't even reason out anymore.,-1
I went back home my dad argued with me only my sister understood what I was feeling and I cried almost the whole night.,1
I suffered a lot for not being able to take medicine and suffered even more for the brutality of my parents for not understanding that who has a phobia is not fussy.,-1
"Yesterday I argued with my older sister, she is very anoying and stuck up.",-1
"Yesterday she was at work and my cousin said that she had chocolate, and I'm crazy for chocolate.",1
"Well today I start to write my virtual diary, since I don't have a single friend to lsiten to me when I need.",1
"My name is Edvania Lemos, I'm married and I have a 12 year old son.",1
I married early and I don't think that was a good choice.,1
When we are young and we fall in love we see everything in a fantasy way and full of good things and then we give ourselves body and soul in the life we think is perfect.,1
"Anyway this is how my dilemma begins, I had a boyfriend when I was 14 and I stayed with him until I was 16, got pregnant and everything went downhill.",-1
I was very nauseous and my poor boyfriend was the one I got the most sick and that's why we set apart from each other and with only 4 months of pregnancy both of us followed our owns paths.,-1
"They were wonderful with me, they stood by my side and helped me in everything.",1
"But out of my own conscience, I decided to support my son myself.",1
"Right when my son turned 5 months I met a friend of my sister, for instance it was a friednship, but within less than 15 days we had our first kiss and what a delicious kiss, right away it was passion.",1
"He immediately took care of me and my son who was still a baby, and it was all perfect!",1
Wow he was so kind and passionate took care of my son and of me like a real man he litteraly assumed it seems that my son was his biological son a perfect father as everyone should be.,1
"We stayed dating until my son turned 1 year old so we got married, bought our house and started a life together.",1
"Everyone was fine he was from the army wasn't payed that much but it was enough, with 2 years of marriage he got promoted to sergeant and of course everything got much better financially.",1
The sex wasn't so good anymore and my husband was very silent and quiet with me.,1
"With regard to our son, he has not changed at all, he has always fulfilled the role he assumed perfectly, a great father, I would never complain about that.",1
One afternoon he arrived saying that he needed to go to an event at the barracks.,1
"He was even irritated because he said he didnt want to go, but he said it was needed.",1
"I, like the good wife I always have been, ironed in his best uniform, shined his boots, left him beautiful and smelled good, he kissed me and left.",1
He arrived at 12:30 PM I was waiting form him anxiously beacuse we always slept together and that's why I was waiting for him.,1
"When he got in it was weird he went straight to take a shower not a even a kiss like usual, I thought it was weird but we made love and slept.",1
"This happened on Wednesday's night, and on Sunday I was making lunch and my husband was watching football with my son.",0
"So someone clapped it's hands in front of the gate it would be there that my life would fall apart, it was a man and my husband went to get it and wow he was so pale nervous I didn't understand why, and stayed at the door how big was my disappointment and agony.",-1
"Hello, who never suffered for love or passion?",1
I think the majority won't even answer only for going through an experience as bad as to these.,1
"There are so many good and bad situations that envolve love and passion, that there is no way to describe all of them.",1
I like a boy for almost three years.,1
"During this time(that isn't short), I've had good and bad(more bad) moments and it looks like I can't get out of this!",-1
"Even when this someone, gives you proof of how he isn't interested, you keep finding ways to revert that.",-1
"When he makes it clear that he DOESN'T LIKE YOU, you cry or/and get sad for a few days, but after think about a way for him to see how special you are.",1
"After one more time having proofs that this someone doesn't want me, I decided that I'll forget him.",1
"No one deserves to keep humiliating itself, crying, anyway, suffering for a person that doesn't value or doesn't want to recieve your FEELINGS.",-1
"This is my advice that I leave to you: VALUE YOURSELF, EVERYONE HAS A SOUL MATE!",1
"My love and I, we were born for each other. It's only left for us to be presented.",1
I'm sad and dissapointed.,-1
My mom assumed to have prejudice against my boyfriend because he is black.,-1
"I told her that it makes no difference to me, but I feel like she doesn't support my relationship.",-1
Like everything was very well and super cool,1
I decided to cut my bangs.,1
Despite the fact that the dumb hairstylist missed.,1
E cortou a minha franja no meio da testa e torta.,-1
We place so much trust and so much feeling in people.,1
"In people we thought we knew, but who, in the end, only proved to be the same as everyone else.",0
"And for expecting too much, dreaming too much, creating too many expectations, we always end up disappointing ourselves and hurting ourselves more and more.",1
Attitude of a fool in love.,-1
"But I really thought it would all work out, that by opening my heart you would, I don't know, say that you felt the same, I swear that I toughtit was going to be like this.",1
"In my dreams I imagined your mouth saying the words that would make me happy, that from that day on it would be you and me forever.",1
"But that's not what happened and nowadays we're not even friends anymore, a friendship of more than five years ended like this.",-1
"But between being your friend and an acquaintance I prefer a thousand times to be your friend I miss our talks, laughs, jokes anyway I miss you in my life!",1
"I wanted to share with you about my relationship, and say what many have already told me.",1
"I met my boyfriend in my 19th birthday, we were taking technical course at the same techical school, and a mutual friend introduced us.",1
"As I had already fell flat on my face in another relationship (in fact, in almost all of them) I didn't pay much attention, but later I got to know him better and started to like him.",1
"Currently I'm 20 years old, he is going to turn 29 in April, I prefer older guys, I'm happy with him and that's what matters.",-1
"Once, I was dating for less than a month when my niece was born, and my boyfriend went to the hospital to meet her and use the opportunity to meet a part of my family, who by the way adores him.",1
"My mother took a picture with him, with my niece and with our friend (who introduced us) that works with him, she is 42.",1
"Then my mother went home and I went to the course with my boyfriend and our friend, when I arrived my mother said that she had posted the picture in her Orkut.",1
"Friend, I just saw the picture of Miih with her boyfriend in your Orkut, don't get me wrong, but he must be much older than her.""",-1
This person that posted this is 56 YEARS OLD and WAS MARRIED AT THE TIME WITH A 24 YEAR OLD GUY.,-1
I got POSSESSED!,1
"I almost cursed at that woman from top to bottom, it's very disrespectful, who is she to criticize my boyfriend?",1
"Nothing against it, of course, but people should bother more with their lifes, at least I think.",1
"Then time passed, and I got in a federal college (today I study in a private, subject for later) and I quickly became friend with the class.",1
A colleague took my phone and saw my picture with my boyfriend.,1
"My boyfriend doesn't seems to be a lot older than me, but that pisses me off, because love doesn't depend on age.",1
"If he was 50 and I loved him, I would be with him without a problem.",1
"I get upset, of course it doesn't shake my relationship these ridiculous comments, but I think that the human being needs to be less indiscreet and have more consideration with others.",1
"Lately I argue with my mom EVERY day, we fight for everything, just yesterday were fighting with my younger sister Bruna, for going through my stuff, and my mom already argued with me.",-1
Mom said that I'm very rebel.,-1
But I think it's because I'm arriving at adolescence and everyone get's like this at this fase of life.,1
5 years without the person that matters the most in this world.,-1
"5 years ago I lost my reason, my hope, I lost my will to live.",-1
"But unfortunetly don't have her, and I'm still alive, so I have to live, even without her.",-1
"I keep going, for her and with her.",0
"I love her more then everything in this life, then, I love my life.",1
"I must keep my head up and go, because I know she wants this, that I follow my dreams, that I become someone.",1
"And you can be sure, mom, I will make you very proud.",1
"Did you know that the boy that will value the most is the one that can't approach you, the one that looks at you and when you realize bows the head or smiles, that can't look eye on eye, and when talking to you keeps smiling like a fool, and many times ends up saying unrelated stuff, somewhat idiots, but you knew that he does it to get a smile from your face?",1
"And because he is to shy to hit on you, it's shyness.",-1
"You knew that these boys that barely say hello to you, have the most truthfull words to be said to you right by your ear.",-1
"They only wait for a day to be able to say, an oportunity, a chance.",-1
"So, why don't you girl don't stop being interested for that boy that has courage to approach you immediately talking about appearance, looking at your body and complimenting you trying to win you by what you are from the outside.",1
"Because the same boy that has courage to speak to you, has enough courage to to go talk with another girl minutes later, and repeat the same words to get where he wants.",1
"While the shy boy needs hours practicing something to say when he sees you, and keeps remembering your smile, even your way of speaking, every expression of yours.",1
"The boy who doesn't have the courage to approach you, has admired you from afar for a long time, and knows you much more than you think, and much more than what the guy with attitude claims to know.",-1
My friends found out why they took me by force and took off my coat to see what I was hiding so much.,1
But I just have this way of expressing what I feel.,1
"Today I'm very calm, very much for real.",1
"You know, I passed a big part of my life worrying about everything, angsty, sad and depressed.",-1
"I thought about following the rules, playing the good boy role, I worried with what others were thinking of me.",1
"Today fuck it, I don't care about what you think about me, I don't care about your popularity, go tell lies fucking far from me, not in my ear.",-1
"I don't care in looking like the good son, when you are a terrible mother.",-1
"Fuck family, I didn't ask to be born in this shit, want to talk bad, talk but after pay for it.",-1
"I don't care about your athourity, if you are my boss, my mother or president of Brazil, to talk to me you ask please and then say thank you very much.",1
"Don't talk loudly to me, because nobody talks loudly to me.",1
My politeness depends on yours!,1
"I don't care about your car, your motorcycle or your wife, if I want, I will go after it.",1
I want you to shove your envy and your falsehood up your ass.,-1
"Don't preach to me about your God, I have my beliefs and I don't need anyone honking in my ear to preach things that he doesn't even practice.",1
"Don't come and tell me that to serve God you have to be inside your damn church throwing money up your thief pastor's ass, and fuck you if you think that because of that I'm going to hell.",-1
"Don't come and talk about my religion, you bastards, who are you to say something, you bunch of shit, you put the bible under your arm and think you're serving God, and at home you curse your mother, you only think about money, fuck with your girlfriends.",1
"Fuck social rules, I don't need to be perfect for anyone, I'm happy the way I am!",1
"Go fuck yourselves for those who don't like me, you think that I depend on your friendship?",-1
"I don't need to give you explanations about where I'm going or what I'm going to do, not even your shitty life worries me.",1
"I'm not worried about nothing, about anyone, fuck it, I'm happy the way I am!",1
"Run through the street, go back home all dirty with earth, games of hide and see, cops and robbers, tag.",1
"I miss the doll games, watching chiquititas on TV, and listen to sandy and junior.",-1
"Playing camp on my grandpas house, and the weird foods that he did !",1
Time when you only went to school to play.,1
Play food with the neighboors !,1
"Go to the best friends/brother's house only to watch tv, and go to his 1000 litre pool.",1
Play goalie with my older brother.,1
"On rainy days or when I had a nightmare, go running to my parent's bed, or sleep next to his bed and make my father sleep all night with his hand around me , if not i couldn't sleep.",-1
"My grandpa , teaching me the homework and trying to remove my baby tooth.",-1
Friendships from school were truthfull.,1
Friendships statements and the crazydrawings on the school notebook.,1
"It's enough knowing how to live, knowing to be free, loving and being loved, knowing to do and be happy !",1
"The ones who dispise the small occurrences will never make big discoveries, small moments change great routs.",-1
"Once again I'm here wailing myself again, I am devastated, my husband he lied to me, created a fake profile on facebook hidden from me, added a lot of woman, including ex-girlfriends.",-1
"I spent all night awake, cried a lot, thought even more, however, I couldn't arrive at a conclusion and want to drop everything and leave.",-1
Go back to live with my parents and pass the rubber on my history with him.,1
"But I'm afraid of not achieving, of regreting, I'm sorrowful, without knowing what to think, I really wanted to let off steam with a friend but I don't have.",1
What he did to me was treason and it's hurting me a lot.,-1
"Today my boyfriend is going to an anniversary, usually he comes to my house every single Saturday.",1
He is sad and I am sad.,-1
Truthfully I didn't even want to wake up today.,1
"The lie kills, but the doubt tortures.",-1
"My friends came here to my house to make a pizza all-you-can-eat , very cool , I ate a lot , we saw a movie , and now they are sleeping here at my house.",1
"I love my boyfriend, we went through so much together and he is without a doubt the best boyfriend someone may want.",1
"I was always alone and it looks like I'm alone every day that goes by, my mind hurts and my tears can't stop.",-1
"These feelings started when I was 14(I think), I don't know what went wrong in my life.",1
"When I was 14, I saw my parents argue, many times my dad left home, discussing with me, and I went home you know, running to my room to cry.",-1
"No one, not even my parents neither my brothers would know why I was crying, never.",-1
"And it's like this until today, suffering, fighting frequently with my parents.",-1
"Today my life is a great shit, I feel so imperfectly weird and a freak, I HATE MYSELF!",-1
"Because I'm not pretty, because I'm a fool,  because I'm not they way my mom wants me to be, I'm not how my family wants me to be.",1
"I hate when I'm so good and people take advantage of it, hate, having to hide all my sorrow my pain and keep it in my heart, I HATE MY LIFE.",-1
"And My life never and never will be something that you can call a life, my friends(colleagues) seem to have a much better life than mine, I don't want having to hide that I'm suffering.",1
"I'M FEELING SICK, and my family seems to see that how I feel, only do complain argue with me curse at me hit me, I am getting so weak that I'm surrending to this feeling of pain.",-1
"I argued yesterday with my grandma, my godmother didn't trust me to go to the bakery to buy bread, told my grandpa to follow.",1
"It's enough, not taking it anymore, I argued with my aunt today with my mom and I'm crying and it seems like I'm alone again like I always were.",-1
"My tears can't stop falling, and know what comes in my mind, death.",-1
"I feel so lonely and hurt inside, my heart is broken is looking through my gaze and I turn up the volume of the music so that the neighbours can't hear my screams of pain , like my world was falling apart. ",-1
"I see the rain falling according to my tears , I see that the day is horrible and I see the consequence in my body.",-1
"Alone in a world where only fake feelings matter, where everyone belive on the lies for fear of acknowledging the truth, for fear that the truth isn't what you wait.",-1
"Rodrigo my friend, he said that was coming back to talk to me by msn, I consider him a great brother to me.",1
"Ah, besides all the suffering all that I'm feeling now, also because my parents don't want me to date such a special person you know.",1
"Will of stick close to you and never let go again,  feel you hands coddling my hair and saying that adores it again, listen your giggle.",1
"My day was good, I woke up early, helped my mom and my dad to get dressed to a party, went to get my friends, ate a lot of barbecue and cake, we stayed cool for some time.",1
I called Nando all day to see if he would come to my party.,1
I was a little angry because he didn't get my calls.,-1
"So I asked my mom to let us go to the cinema, she let, we cut the cake and went to the cinema, we went to see Avengers, very cool.",1
I bought a book.,0
I went to look at my phone as usual and there saw a message.,-1
"When I read this message I thought I'll call him to see how he is, and try to advance what he wants to tell me.",1
We started talking and everything was doing fine until he said that he would come back to see if they'll let him leaning at work or for him to sign the resignation letter.,1
"My heart broke in millions of pieces, I started crying immediately, he asked me not to cry, and said that it was also hard for him.",-1
He is only doing it because he can't handle anymore his mom and when they fought he took all his clothes and put on a bag and did the biggest bitchiness with him.,-1
Today I woke up and saw your side of the bed empty.,-1
Your smell is still there somehow on my imagination.,1
I always closed the window and argued with you for it being open.,1
And now the window is always open like you always asked me and I didn't even realize.,1
I argued with you for letting the TV and many room lights turned on.,1
And now all of them are on and I didn't even realize.,0
Your side of the closet is empty and I didn't filled it.,-1
Your side of the shoe rack was full of shoes that never ended and I always complained about the mess.,-1
On the bathroom your drawers are empty.,-1
The window is not with your dozens of shampoos.,-1
On the closet there's one thing left and I don't know if it's yours.,0
It's a travel tooth brush that might be that my mom has forgotten when she came to take your stuff,1
On my computer I have countless pictures of you.,-1
I have countless pictures of you with other people that I hate.,-1
"I hate not because they did me something, but for the fact that you gave yourself up to them.",-1
"Besides all the hate, I miss you.",-1
With holidays or weekends getting closer and I count the hours to go to my parents house.,1
I haven't looked for friends and not even anyone.,1
When I was with you complained that didn't have time for family and friends.,-1
"Now I simply don't complain about anything, keep quiet retaining all of this inside me.",1
The desire to cry comes back.,1
My eyes start to fill with tears.,-1
Before I met you I had a lot of friends.,1
"I left home early and came back very late, that when I came back.",1
I went out around the world enjoying everything that could without a time to finish.,1
I had no fears.,1
"I had loves, achievements.",1
"I did this, because I didn't know what was love.",1
"She goes out with her friends, with the boys.",1
I've already asked this to myself and came three times and today the sorrow is a thousand times worse.,-1
This time I'll have to be strong.,1
"I am not a person to talk about dreams or true facts, but because it was an experience of such proportions that I'll give this up.",1
"I'm in a relationship with someone from my work, yes we work at the same company but in different places, describe him is talk about a tall man, with a voice that makes you all wet, yes it's a voice that needs no comment.",-1
"His body is spectacular, I just can't get enough of it, his smile is as naughty as the owner.",1
"We were apart for a few days, when he calls me asking if I had forgotten him because I was missing.",-1
"We met, but we were so thirtsy for each other that I felt his member in me, this while, we were ""devouring"" each other with mouth-watering kisses.",1
He moaned in a way that gets you really excited.,-1
"When he turned me, he kissed me so much that we started to cum together.",1
"My body shivered, more then his, I got wobbly legs.",-1
We took a shower together and when we started to dry ourselves he threw me on the bad and his mouth makes me moan.,-1
"My head and my heart were racing so much, that I always waited for him so I could cum.",1
This time he made me cum in a way that my hole body shivered.,1
After 6 hours of pleasure we went out of the motel.,1
But I still was in ecstasy.,1
"I met a friend of my sister one of these days, he is 17 years old from what I saw, he is very sluttish, I so I decided, ""study"" his type and I'll give some advice to the girls in love that read this.",1
Today will be the day that he will be completely and crazy in love with you if everything goes right.,1
"Give him all the love in the world, without falling in temptation.",1
"Today I'm very upset, I think that I'm being cheated on by my husband he is treating me differently with a lot of coldness.",-1
"He already cheated on me once and I forgave him, he is acting the same as the other time, trating me with the biggest coldness.",-1
I spoke to my ex.,0
"We only know things living, many judge.",-1
"Only who really knows, it's me who is living, feeling.",0
"He said that he doesn't want me to break up, doesn't want to see me alone.",-1
"He told me he really likes me, and asked me to be patient.",1
"It's only for me to break up, whe he breaks up.",-1
"What I want the most is to work things out with my husband, live a love intensely with him.",1
"Pronounce that I admire you, that I like you is too little.",-1
"Because this friendship deserves more than words, deserved to be told around the world, so that everyone could feel, and maybe even understand the meaning of our friendship.",1
"But lately I can't take stand it, it's like I needed something something more, or better, I need, I need you.",-1
"What I'm feeling for you is something that neither I myself can explain, I tried getting involved with many, tried forgetting you in many ways, but I can't, it's stronger than me.",-1
"Not even a your kiss I got, but I can affirm that it wasn't necessary for me to deeply fall in love with you.",1
"I wanted to forget the light of your eyes, because this way I wouldn't miss them, I wanted to forget the sound of your voice, your way of speaking, I wanted to forget this beautiful smile that only you have.",1
"I wanted so, but I can't, because what I feel for you is so strong, impossible to forget.",-1
"But one thing is certain, I love you very much and even though I want to forget you, I love you more and more, today more than yesterday, tomorrow more than ever.",1
"Being without you is having notion of the time and not knowing how to fill it, is losing peace and knowing the absence of someone present.",-1
"Waiting is painful, forgetting is painful, but not knowing what to do is the worst kind of suffering.",-1
"I've waited so long to get to this point, I don't know what else to do, I'm afraid of losing your friendship, actually, I believe I lost it, because you don't even want to accept me anymore.",-1
But the fear of you getting away from me is bigger than everything.,-1
Pay attention to the songs that I listen and the things I post.,1
"In the way I treat you, In how I worry about you.",1
"I really needed to tell you this, I couldn't take it anymore.",0
"When night comes, time to sleep, I lay my head on the pillow and my thoughts transport me to a wonderful world.",1
"I think I'm in his arms, huddled and shy, passionate and fulfilled.",-1
I feel the strength and warmth of the man of my life.,1
I dream about you all night and I feel anxious and insecure for not knowing if one day I will turn this dream into reality.,1
Do not be astonished by this confession.,-1
It really is a bold declaration of love.,1
I don't want it to disturb you and take away your peace.,-1
"On the contrary, I would like to always be by your side to love you and give you a lot of affection.",1
I want all the peace of mind for you.,1
"Think about it, know that I love you so much, I wish your company a lot.",1
I want to give you all my love.,1
Cover you with kisses and satisfy all your desires.,1
"That's all I had the courage to dream of, hoping to one day see this claim come true.",1
"Now you must know why I can't stand your girlfriends, because they were always with the boy I really love and the one I want to be with and always wanted.",1
"It may be that what I said doesn't matter at all, because you started a new relationship a short time ago, but I needed to express myself anyway.",1
"And I hope you understand me, because I didn't ask to fall in love, because the heart is in charge of us.",-1
"Honestly, love is not chosen, it just happens.",1
"Things happen at the worst times, it's part of that long journey called life.",-1
"I woke up as usual at 6:20 am to go to school, got ready, and went.",1
"Arriving there I spoke with my friends and went to the corridor where I wait for my boyfriend every day until 7:20, he then arrived, put his materials away and came to talk to me.",1
"He walked over to me, gave me that really tight hug and said I love you.",1
"He asked if I was better (I've just been crying lately), I told him I was normal, but I can't fool him, he knew I wasn't well.",1
"As I entered my room, my eyes filled with tears, I had to contain myself, because the girls who claim to be my friends would only want to know why I was crying and would criticize me.",-1
"So I spent 3 classes holding myself back so I wouldn't cry and trying to study, because I was going to take 3 tests after the break.",-1
"So after those 3 hours, the break came, I met my boyfriend again, we went downstairs together and went to the patio to sit as usual in the same place we sit every day.",-1
I was dying to cry so I held back the tears and told him I couldn't look at him that if I looked at him my eye would start to water.,-1
"It was complicated, because I couldn't concentrate on anything else, what I wanted most was to finish these exams and go home crying everything I held back.",-1
"Finishing the test, I went downstairs and found him in the patio, he took the book from my hand and we went to the stop, when we got there we sat down and started talking, conversation went on.",1
"I confess that I was very upset about this, because I never stopped thinking about him in these 10 months of dating, I always gave him things on commemorative dates, when I got home, I cried a lot.",1
Then my boyfriend and I had a falling out on the phone and I started crying.,-1
"I love him so much and I don't want to lose him never, because he is the reason of my smiles, of my happiness!",1
"We always say we won't fall in love for the wrong people, but without realizing it, we are already enchanted by the person without even knowing them well.",-1
"Giving ourselves too much, believing and we always suffer from it.",-1
"We give them our heart, pride and all our love.",1
"And how many times have we cried for the person who doesn't deserve a drop of our tears, we run after them and we don't see the truth, and many times we don't want to see it, because the truth hurts and hurts a lot.",-1
"And when we find that special person that makes you smile, forgets your past and makes you think about the present, we don't stop thinking about them, we become obsessed with them, we learn to like what they like and to do what they do just to say that we have a lot in common.",1
"And when you wake up, you already wake up with them in your head, thinking that I miss them, and dreaming big, putting that person in our life.",1
Many times that person hurt our feelings without even knowing what we feel.,-1
"The worst thing is when we get attached to that person and they leave, not knowing that the one that stayed is still in love, that they can't imagine their life without them, and we say life goes on, but a part of us they take with people passing.",1
"Our heart is always the victim, it always get broken into pieces.",-1
It races when the person gets close and beats harder because it already thinks that is your other half.,1
"And when that person gets close we shake, our hands sweat, our heart races, our world gets different, because the person is very special.",1
Guys I'd like to let off steam with you about my story with my family.,1
"My mom was a single mom, I didn't have a dad.",0
