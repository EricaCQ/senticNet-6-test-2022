"And my boyfriend was in jeans shorts, a polo, an oakley tennis without shoelace at left foot, dirty and scratched.",-1
"It's disgusting, I took the corporate bus and when I went up, he took out one arm of the shirt and was going to take out the rest.",-1

"I think i got 35 correct, of 50.",1
"I never regret so much, I doubt 'll pass with these hits, to be approved on Edifications must hit 40 to up.",-1
Surely i will not be part of the top 24.,1
I will die embarassed when the result comes out!,-1
"Everyone keeps talking i already passed, but they don't mind that i choose the most competitive course!",1
"I'm so bad, i should have listened my math theacher and choose another course.",-1

"Me and my fear of take new remedies, afraid to give me a some colateral reaction or something like that.",-1
"But was ok. Lay down and sleep like a baby, the two times i took.",1
"When i wake up, don't spend the day harm.",-1
Wake up more willing.,1
Loved the remedy until now.,1
Last week i had sex with my boyfriend at his house.,1
"He, like i preview, don't have condom, and i refused to have sex that way.",-1

"Today, at holiday eve, she was, by coincidence, at the same group that him, and decided to ask if he likes me, but he told only as a friend.",1
"But then, she started to talk i like him and in the end, praised his green eyes.",1
"This boy is not cocky, he is a good person, but for some time now, i fell in love for him.",1
He probably will talk to me by facebook.,0

I took refuge in umbanda with my guides and others'.,1
"It was so many difficulties, many mysteries, so many questions without explanation.",-1
I have lost the count of how many ways i already tried to descover the truth.,1
"Wrong yards, wrong guides, lack of education with the people, reponsability, lack of attitude, lack of luck, miss of going out, of chase, excessive wank, cards, tarot, opening jobs.",1
"In how many causes i already thinked to be the reason of my suffering, and until now i've not founded the answer!",1
"Today with 21, as by divine aid, i started to se this week reports of people who are curated through past life terapy.",1
"Symptoms that i always suffered like shyness, depression, isolation, bad oriented mediumship, family fights, lack of affection and professional life, i tried to search any form of auto regression, but didn't find.",1
"So I decided to search on google for some clinic who did past lifes therapy in Goiania, until then i don't even know that this exists here, had only seen by television.",1
"I founded Crisanne Braga's blog, a great therapist from here in the city, i read some articles in her blog and contacted wanting to know the values.",1

I confirmed and was waiting for the time.,0
"Internal bus stopped and asked if I would go to Benq, i said no.",0

"I'm alone despite being married, but since a long time this marriage has been nothing more than a signed paper, love has gone with respect and trust, all that's left is complacency, sadness and lack of hope for miss my wife.",1
"I've done and suffered things that make me feel like crap, I've been through situations that you can't wish even for your worst enemy, I won't go into detail today, but as long as time goes I'll talk about it.",1
"I'm alone, my wife was out for the day and said she was at her mother's house, I say she said because I fear I've been cheated on for some time.",-1
"I've already hurted my wife in so many ways, I don't even have the courage to call her, even though I think she might be in a motel with someone else.",-1
"I don't have the courage to demand loyalty and that for a man is the greatest shame, I'm not a man, I'm not a person, I'm nothing with drugs.",-1
"I'm here, feeling the taste of the drug that is still running down my throat from my nose, I'm depressed, almost on despair and with an immense sadness.",-1
"I know the excessive sadness is due to drug effects, I know that this chemical sadness will pass, but the real sadness for the life I have, this one is with me every day.",1
"I don't know what to say, what to do, I'm lost, I asked for help even to my dog in a psychotic hope that he would respond, or do something magical.",1
"I just don't have anyone to appeal, I don't have mother or family because of the disagreements I had with my mother who was always violent and sick.",-1
Always lost control and used demonic malice in the beatings she gave me.,-1
"My father, never really was a father figure, overshadowed by my mother's strength.",1
"My sister, I have nothing with her, she doesn't even exist for me, my brother, I feel sorry for him, but he lives well despite everything.",1

"It is now 00:03, I'm depressed, alone and uncertain of my future.",-1

"Well, this is my first text so let me introduce myself, my name is Kevin, I live in PE.",0
"Since last night, my mom won't even look me in the face or talk to me.",-1
I woke up today and she didn't even look at me.,1
She has a habit of telling me things and then saying it to my face that she didn't say anything about.,1
"Like, last week I made her hair done, because I take a hairdressing course, so I have to train, but of course a brush and flat iron, I know how to do it perfectly.",1
"So I did her hair, I brushed it out to match the cut, then she came back saying it was horrible and order me to do it all over again, but inwards.",-1
"Last week, she asked me to do her hair again, so I did it, outside and stuff.",-1
"Then she came saying that it was horrible, that I didn't know how to do anything properly, that my course was worthless and other people do better than me.",-1
"That really hurts me, imagine, it would hurt anyone, wouldn't it?",-1
"Then when it was today, Me, my mother and father were in the room, then my mother said that I never did anything for her, that I was never willing to give opinions about her hair and stuff.",-1
"Then I told my father what she had told me that day, she said it is a lie, that I am a liar and she didn't say anything about it.",-1
"Man, that makes me angry with her.",-1
Why does she lie like that?,-1
"And it wasn't the first time, she always lies.",-1
"She tells me things and then says she didn't, calls me a liar.",-1
I like her a lot and I know she loves me.,1
"My grandmother passed away, I am not getting to deal with this situation.",1
"I'm afraid of falling into depression again, my heart has a huge void, I try to do everything to occupy my head, pass my time and nothing consoles me, nothing makes me take out of my mind the image of her last breath.",-1
"I love you grandma, continue to take care of me wherever you are, thank you for the wonderful grandma you were with me, for every gesture of affection and smile.",1
"You were, are, and always will be my warrior, you didn't lose to cancer, but cancer lost to you, my warrior.",-1
"You were still playing, made us smile and whenever someone said, 'how are you, Dona Maria?'",1
"You always answered, I'm doing well thank God, what a warrior woman you were grandma, I love you so much.",1
"What an immense pain this longing is, every day when I wake up I pick up the phone wanting to call to see how you are, I think I still haven't been able to discern all that.",-1
"I love you and each one of your gesture will stay here inside my heart to remind of your love for us, I love you.",1
I will miss you you are a piece of me that will be dearly missed.,-1
Why do I feel so bad and negative?,-1
"I went to the doctor and he said that all these pains I'm feeling are caused by nervousness, and how am I going to calm down?",-1
"Not everything went as wrong as it is going now, but I STILL believe this year is going to be good.",1
"Man, I cry sometimes without realizing it and bite my mouth so I don't break down in front of someone.",-1
"Hear rubbish from my father and watch my mother proposing ridiculous things makes me worse, more nervous.",-1
"More useless pain, no pain that helps grow or mature.",1
I just want my life back and just want all this to be over.,1
My immunity no longer supports it.,1
"I went to the gym today, as promised.",1
"It was full today and it sucks, it takes longer.",1
"I met a new girl there, I think we'll be friends.",1
"But a funny thing has happened, actually since day one.",1
"It's my instructor, he's always drooling my egg man, from the moment I arrive until I leave.",1
"The other two times it was like this too, but now it's too much.",-1
"And I'm a person who doesn't understand when someone is interested in me, but in this case I'm suspicious of it.",-1
"Today I got there at 7 o'clock, he came smiling, said the things he had to do, and machine by machine he came and told me something.",1
"On the last machine he stayed on my side and I said I was tired, then he said: 'If you want, you can stay there until 10 pm, because we close the gym'.",-1
"When I left he gave me a candy, 'serenade of love'.",1
"The worse is it's just him there at the time I go, and I get embarrassed about that, right?",-1
"But, I didn't even bother him, even because he didn't even ask me for anything, he just treated me that way, being a sycophant.",1
"I'm going to dinner, date with the most handsome boy in the world.",1
"Well, today my friends and I came up with the idea of doing the Pen Game.",1
Maybe the way my friends and I do it is wrong but it seems to be real.,1
"Well my name is Daniele Felix, I'm 15 years old and I have no one to vent to so I chose here.",-1
I'm upset with everything that's happening to me.,-1
"A few months ago I rediscovered a friend, then he started giving me ideas and I started believing he said a lot of beautiful things.",1
"I was very sad because I liked him a lot and I was willing to do everything for him then the tears fell without control so I told everything to my friend, she is helping me a lot.",1
But he left me as a second option.,0
"Went to a barbecue at a friend's house, and met her, Carol her name, later I found out it was Jessica but that's ok.",1
"I kissed her and then we went to a motel, that day I joked with her saying that she would fall in love with me.",-1
"I confess that I enjoyed a lot to spend time with her, it was very good, but I left, I thought she wouldn't want to see me again.",-1
After sometime we ended up seeing each other and hooking up more often.,1
"But there is something about her that bothered me a lot, her way of seeing life was vulgar, she thought only in parties, going out to drink, enjoying herself, as if that were in the first place in her goals.",-1
"But now before I finish, I'm feeling strange, I think I ended up liking her, her way of taking care of me, of wanting me to be always with her, her way of feeling jealous, and of always wanting me close to her, always saying that she misses me, that she doesn't mind spending time with me locked in a room talking, to be honest, I'm going to miss her.",-1
"Right now I'm avoiding her, and it's giving a pain to me, in my heart, but I have to do this, there's no way I can go on, and I'm very jealous and intolerant of these kinds of things, there's not the slightest chance of she and I get along.",-1
"I will miss her, but this is the life, sometimes we have to give up something to continue on our way.",-1
"Lately I've been very compulsive - for masturbation with the dildo, for food, a little aggressive, shaking, biting myself, teasing me.",-1
"It wasn't a sex at all, but it was nice.",1
"And we had sex twice more in a motel - I didn't reach orgasm, to be honest my vibrator gives me more pleasure, but anyway, anything that gives pleasure I accept.",1
"In the last psychiatric consultation, he wanted to give me a neuroleptic (I refused at the time, I'm out of get fat) and in return he suggested a mood stabilizer.",1
"He kind of suggested I have borderline personality and bipolar spectrum (cyclothymia) anyway, nothing I didn't already suspect.",-1
I did not accept the stabilizer for the same reason as risperidone.,-1
"I'm a fat whale, I don't want to get fat anymore and that's it.",-1
He thought I was better and put only one fluoxetine pill in the prescription.,1
"Alright, having these hypomanic spells is kind of embarrassing - but being depressed and with suicidal ideas isn't cool either.",-1
I've been very stressed lately.,-1
I fought with my mother because of the notebook she didn't want to lend me to do my work and I burned myself with the candle.,1
I got a new laptop.,0
"I had a crying fit while having sex with my boyfriend, accusing him of not loving me, of treating me like an object and for him not to touch me anymore.",-1
He wanted to have anal sex with me and was insisting a lot.,-1
"Okay, my reaction was super exaggerated, it didn't have to be like that.",1
"Later he told me that I value and devalue him very quickly, that I constantly change my mood, at times I'm sad and at other times super happy, and he asked me if I had any personality or mood disorders.",1
I am writing disjointed words because my mind is disjointed.,-1
My thinking is confused and disorganized.,-1
"Yes, it embarrasses me, I like to be in control.",1
I'm in charge during sex.,-1
"I get on top of him, I ride him, I say I paid for this fucking motel for an hour and a half and I want to have sex until an hour and a half.",1
Finally on vacation.,1
"Well, my psychiatrist wanted me to try being on just one fluoxetine pill.",0
It wasn't even 2 weeks and I couldn't stand it and I asked him to go back to the previous dosage - 2 pills.,1
"I was the whole time 'I want to kill myself, kill myself' I wasn't sleeping, anguish and screaming anxiety, crying over everything.",-1
Lately my sexual and aggressive instincts have been touched upon.,1
And I think I'm getting addicted to looking at pornography on the internet.,-1
"Well, I can't take this anxiety anymore.",-1
And I was particularly attracted to scenes of sadomasochism,1
"At the same time they make me feel good, but at the same time they make me sick.",-1
I start to remember my aggressions and humiliations and I feel bad.,-1
"I don't know, it's such a strange thing.",-1
"And I'm left feeling like I'm some slut too, just like them - who am I to call someone a slut anyway?",-1
" And the moans are so forced, it sounds more like they're giving birth than having sex - no sex, it's more like copulation.",-1
"But anyway, sex is sex, and that relaxes me.",1
"I don't want to look like a whale, I'm already too fat !",-1
At least porn doesn't make you fat.,1
I can't stand being away from my boyfriend anymore - I want to fuck!,-1
He traveled and I'm here in the drought.,1
He's trying to control me now.,1
I had another phase of mood swings in front of him and he threatened to break up with me if I didn't take the mood stabilizers.,-1
"Well, I've been doing some research and the coolest one that I found was lamotrigine, which is not fattening.",1
"Topiramate makes you lose weight, but harms your memory, and for a university student that's not cool at all.",-1
"Well, I still don't know if I'll use it.",0
I'm afraid of turning into a robot.,-1
Today my class went to the library after break.,1
"At break time I was there looking at the books, to see which one I was going to choose, I didn't find any interesting.",1
"There was one there ""Biloca's diary"" is a small and short book.",-1
It doesn't have that many pages and the writer wasn't known to me either!,1
" I picked it up thinking it was one of those children's books that say : ""Dear diary.. Today I learned to read.. """,1
Biluca is not a very well known name.,-1
"So, I haven't even had time to read a page of the book and it's already hit.",-1
I went to class and little after my teacher took us to the library.,1
 I rented the book and left.,-1
 When the librarian went to deliver the book she almost died of embarrassment for taking that book.,1
 But I ended up reading it and was really interested in it.,1
I've already read half of the book and I can tell it's totally different from what I thought.,1
Talks about an almost teenager (almost because she's still graduating and etc) my God.,1
"The Discovering of new feelings, new actions and such.",1
"When I read the rest of the book, I won't miss the chance to do the summary.",1
"Mom, I'm sorry for being who I am, for being so and only me, for being ""different"", for being so wrong in your eyes.",-1
" I'm sorry, or rather, forgive me for not being the daughter of your so perfect dreams, for I just disappoint you when you expected the most of me.",1
 But it's just that it's so hard for me to please you.,-1
"On the contrary, I love you very much!",-1
" I love you more than myself, after all you are my mother.",1
"Hate, I don't have it for you, nor for my father even though he is absent.",1
"Hate, i have for myself for not being the daughter you always wanted and desired: and as much as I try - yes, I try",1
Sorry I didn't grow up the way or the way you expected.,-1
But you just don't know how it hurts when you disapprove everything I do for you.,-1
You don't know how it hurts me when you put me down and humiliate me in front of anyone.,-1
"I just wanted to be proud of you, but it turns out I'll never really be good enough for you, and I can't pretend like everything's okay anymore, because it's not!",1
"I'm sorry, but I will never be perfect and that, believe me, hurts me more than it hurts you.",-1
"I can't take our fights anymore, they leave me in a state that I can't even explain in words.",-1
"And nothing will change the things you told me, nothing will make 'us' work again.",-1
"But Mom, please don't leave me like that.",0
"I can't believe it's so hard to talk to you, to my own mother.",-1
"Yesterday [Sunday] I couldn't write here because I was ""busy"".",-1
I went out on Saturday for bridal shower of my cousin who will marry soon.,1
"It was me, my sister, boyfriend, father and mother.",0
My boyfriend slept at my house.,0
" I share a room with my sister, so I stayed in my bed, he on the mattress (on the floor next to me) and my sister in her bed which is right next door (close).",1
"We got home from the party and went right away ""to sleep"", my sister was the first to fall asleep, while my boyfriend and I stayed hand in hand (he lying down and me too... and talking softly).",1
Until suddenly my sister gets up and starts crying like crazy.,-1
"In the end, she ended up sleeping with my father, and my mother in her (my sister's) bed).",1
"My mother is very nice, she has the air of a teenager and the head of a woman.. she is always in a good mood, when we go to parties she dances, shakes things up, infects everyone.",-1
"Her relationship with my boyfriend is great, they both play and I love it.",1
"Then he hugged me, kissed me and we curled up and talked for a while and then we slept.",1
"I'm very cold, when I was in my bed, I took 3 blankets and I was wearing a cold sweater.",-1
As soon as he hugged me I started to feel hot too and I took off my jacket.,1
"When I woke up, my boyfriend had his hand on my waist, hugging me, and his head was close to my hair.",-1
"Says he got up before me, and kissed my face, and I couldn't move because I was so sleepy.",-1
We got up and went to buy my mom a beer.,1
" After a while, we lay down on the couch (it was already afternoon) because he wanted to watch the game that was going to be on TV.",1
"When I woke up he hugged me, kissed me calling me lazy and said ""I love you"" He's too handsome.",1
"We spent the rest of the day embraced, we agreed to go to the mall so he could pay a bill, but who said the lazy allow?",1
"So that's it, I'm done here, today I'm very happy and I miss him already, we are clingy in our own way, and I love that.",1
 It's great to have someone you love by your side.,1
"Besides, awaking up with an I love you makes the day wonderful and happy.",1
"Anyway, Good Evening, and I would like to thank you for your comments on the previous subject.",1
"Well it all started in April last year when my mother started dating a man I don't even know where he appeared from, well they were dating for a week and he was already living inside my house",0
"On his birthday I saw him hiding drugs in my room, and I went there and told my mom.",-1
They had a fight and she broke up with him.,-1
"But then at 5 am I wake up to my mother screaming and asking for help, he had entered the house and was trying to kill her.",1
"It wasn't enough to have a criminal in the house, he wouldn't let my mother talk to me anymore, he wouldn't let go of her.",1
" And in this song he starts to say some things about love, and I think everything he says is just beautiful!",1
"A feeling of failure came over me, sadness, despondency and a total despondency for life.",-1
"I feel my life is so messed up, I see my dreams dying, my life taking the opposite direction from what I imagined one day.",-1
Why could I never feel complete?,-1
My heart is broken today.,-1
"I arrived at work today so discouraged, I see so much to do but I have no motivation, I get angry when I think that I try so hard to give the best of myself in this company and people indirectly interfere with my work.",-1
" At home things go from bad to worse, the situation of my brother and sister-in-law drags on, causing enormous suffering for my family.",1
I wonder what they are waiting for to separate and end this suffering once and for all.,1
"It's weird the way I still think about him, I want to call him.",-1
"I was very childish, the worst thing I still am, I'm not a little girl anymore, I'm a woman, there are things I can't help myself.",-1
"I see a lot of girls suffering from little boys who don't give a shit about them, so to gain attention they pretend to be something they are not.",-1
"I find that ridiculous, understand if he doesn't like you now, it's no use my daughter, in fact it does, if you have a huge ass and a big chest, he might even think about being interested in you.",-1
"But it's no use wanting to put on a cleavage, and a pair of shorts tucked up your ass, girls like that are only seen as a sexual object.",-1
"Well I did some research with some boys and they said that girls speaking slang is normal, but talking a lot is weird.",-1
"The thing is, don't get behind him, I know it's hard not to show your feelings, but you can be sure, they don't value girls who are behind them, bothering them all the time.",-1
"If he brings up the subject, it means that he likes talking to you, but if you bring up the subject, and he answers you with short sentences or takes a long time to answer and comes with a little apology apologizing for the delay, it means that you You're getting on his nerves and he only responds to you out of politeness.",1
"Before you send it, first see how the course was between the two on the day.",0
"When you see him give him a few glances, (but don't hide it) at first he won't understand, but stare at him for 1 second, then gently ruffle his hair while looking elsewhere.",-1
So he will try to know what you want.,0
"A lot of girls want to get attention from guys by laughing out loud or talking loudly, that's a little girl thing with no attitude, and you don't want to be seen like that, right?",1
Post phrases about a detached girl who doesn't need a man to be happy.,-1
"When the phone rings, my heart races",1
Loving you when watching the sun rise in the morning,1
"But you know, it's weird to think this is natural, I feel completely bad for him showing interest in others, I consider it disrespectful.",-1
"Looking surreptitiously at a pretty woman is natural, what woman doesn't know that a handsome man has walked past her too?",1
"But the question is, show interest in another person, show that you are noticing, staring?",1
Saying that life is made of choices is extremely easy.,1
Making the right choices is the hard part.,1
"At 27 years old, I imagine myself still studying something that interests me, if I have to study everything again, I imagine myself with a certificate of respect in my hand, I imagine myself having gone through the best and funniest things in life.",1
I imagine visiting my family on the weekends and listening to the rubbish my dad talks and always will talk about.,1
"I imagine myself thinking about children, after all I have a dream: to adopt.",1
I imagine myself passing near my parents' house and leaving a warm bread in the afternoon.,1
"I imagine myself at peace with myself, with everything I've done in my life.",1
"I've never gotten ready so quickly, I'm glad I live a five minute drive from work.",1
Today my friend (Luciano) made me freak out.,1
"Near our school there is a health center and I asked him to go there and get a condom for me, because even though I'm a girl I think it's good to have it in case I'm having sex with someone to have a condom and stay protected.",-1
I had to go to the lottery outlets to pay some bills (as I always leave everything until the last minute) and the queue seemed like a snail to me.,-1
"After an hour I made it, got my bus and a horrible traffic jam.",-1
"My birthday I worked all day, almost 8:00 pm and I'm here in this horrible traffic, I'm going to get home just to sleep and today is my day I didn't enjoy anything.",1
"It was perfect, my sister and my husband made everything, 2 types of pies, everything was beautiful.",1
Thank you my God for the life of my husband!,1
"Like that, you kissing hot and doing everything you're entitled to within four walls.",1
Me and my boyfriend had so much fun today.,1
"We were at the bus stop, we played like in the movies, he ran after me, grabbed me by the waist, tickled me, picked me up, lifted me off my feet from the ground.",1
It felt so good for a moment to forget all my problems.,-1
"I went to the salon on Saturday to have my hair straightened, finally good hair and not bad hair, I couldn't stand that Straw.",1
"Always at night and I'm afraid, terrified and I never sleep in the dark, here's a small light that stays on, on my wedding night I want to do it in the light.",-1
Today I went to sleep at 9 am because I had gone to sleep at my boyfriend's house without my parents knowing.,1
I had to come home early as if I had gone to a club but ended up went nowhere.,-1
I had to come home early as if I had gone to a club but ended up went nowhere.,-1
I took advantage of the fact that I was already awake and called my boyfriend because we were going to see each other again.,1
I ended up meeting someone I love and she loves me too.,1
"I'm seriously thinking about running away from home and taking a break, and then living with my beloved!",-1
I thought I would never love anyone in my life and it happens now in old age.,1
My God I'm so anxious I imagine me and my beloved together all the time.,1
"My husband in 10 years has not been able to put anything in the house the bills are late the fridge is empty, he is lazy!",-1
"I recorded a movie on TV, and now I wanted to go see it.",1
" The story tells of three chubby friends, who one day, get tired of being the way they are, get tired of seeing other people's looks of enjoyment, get tired of not being able to do what other women do, get tired of being ""badochas"".",-1
"Then, they decide to make a pact, the cinderella pact, where they promise each other that they will do everything to lose weight.",1
"And they succeed, they lose weight and become women with a perfectly normal weight, and much prettier!",1
"But that's going to change from today onwards, because from today I'm going to do my best, and I'm going to be able to follow a healthy diet to lose weight.",1
"And I'm going to prove to everyone that, like all the other girls, I too can have an athletic body and be very skinny and perfect.",1
"Because I'm going to lose weight, and I'm going to prove to everyone that I'm not just any fat girl.",1
"We already left, and this is the third time I'm reporting this to.",1
We had already scheduled via cell phone on Sunday.,1
Monday there would be some really good sex in bed.,1
"Well, we work in the same company, however, in different sectors, she's blonde, long hair, delicious.",1
We combined and there she was waiting for me in the parking lot.,0
"We left and went during ""working hours"" to a motel called Beira Rio, close to our work.",1
"Once we got there we went to a stand suite, super comfortable and there it started, hot kisses all over my neck and I soon saw that she was super hot.",1
"I took off my pants and I was only in gray boxers and a black tank top, she went to the bathroom and when she came back she came back with killer red thong panties.",1
she sat on top of me and rubbed against me hot.,1
"However, being alone is the absolute opposite of being with someone.",-1
Being alone is closing your hands on nothing when you run across the street and don't have a hand to hold.,-1
"Being alone is sad, it bothers others and must be bad for your health.",-1
I found out from my mother that my stepfather was cheating on her.,1
I also found out that he was cheating on my mother with my aunt.,1
And on top of that he smashed my mom.,1
He threatened me and said he would kill me.,-1
"I still can't stop to cut myself, I know this is a problem but it's hard.",-1
"Sometimes I get in my head that nobody likes me, my mother is boring, the only one who can be saved and that I still haven't done anything silly, because he won't let me, it's Vinny.",-1
"Sometimes I feel sad, I'm 12 years old and I'm BVL, most of my friends aren't BVL, and the worst part is that I think I'm ugly.",-1
I've never loved anyone the way I loved you.,-1
We are living in a world where physical appearance is worth more than inner appearance.,1
"Before taking the history test, we prayed this prayer and I still pray it to this day. It's been 3 years since I've seen the teacher who taught us this prayer but I really like her.",1
True friendships are what the world needs.,-1
Today was a day of so many surprises and joy.,1
"I came here after the light came back, I was looking at the picture of him that I have.",1
And I don't know what I'm feeling right now but I feel calm and happy but whatever...,-1
He completes me when you feel you're missing something but you never knew what it was and then you find someone who understands you and every bit the opposite of you and then you feel complete.,1
"Look, I'm not very tall, but enough for my age and I'm underweight.",-1
"Whenever you do those screenings at school, I'm always alerted because I'm under and I don't like it!",-1
"When I try to warn the people closest to me they say 'you're thin, must get fat' and this stuff, but when I try to play with the situation to alert them, they say oh but you're not very tall either.",-1
Then guys also like girls who have some body. Not the ones who only look like they have bones.,-1
I don't have any siblings and for various reasons I've learned that my best friends don't know how to keep secrets.,1
"I look very happy, because I learned that crying doesn't solve anything and that ended up making everyone trust me with things, because they know I'm very positive and secure.",1
"Those who have dated and never missed their ex, let the first stone be thrown.",1
"When we are in love, within us there is a confusion of feelings that we are lost.",1
"I dated a boy named Luan, he is 3 months younger than me, and maybe my mistake could be start that way, because the women mature before men.",1
"But we had a perfect relationship, it was everyone's envy.",-1
His friends started to hate me because he just wanted to be with me.,1
"All we cared about was our opinion, and we dated for 9 months.",1
"One day, we had a fight and I couldn't stand it and broke up",-1
"After that we would stay hidden from time to time, so that no one would disrupts anymore.",1
"But I just couldn't stand it, being treated as a friend in front of others so that later when we were alone I could have any kind of touch.",1
"Watch out kid, she laughs at your dumbest jokes.",1
She is interested in all her affairs without foot and without head.,-1
"So, she's there to put up with you talking about trivial things, she just wants to see her mouth move and the sound of her voice come out.",-1
"She doesn't mind listening to her loving complaints, no matter how much she hurts, she will always be there to support you.",-1
All she cares about is seeing you look good.,1
"When she gets on your nerves, don't fight, she just likes to see you a little irritated, because she knows that later you'll crack a smile, and she loves that smile.",1
"I see that I'm surrounded by fake people, lying naughty men when I think I've found someone different, it's a mistake, just a fake and a liar.",-1
"I'll learn to live without you, and God willing I'll be happy too.",1
I will always fondly remember everything I experienced with you.,1
"Zootechnists are professionals responsible for the study and control of reproduction, genetic improvement and nutrition of animals raised for commercial purposes, which aim to increase production and improve the quality of products of animal origin.",1
"They carry out experiments with food and research ways to guarantee hygiene conditions and to prevent and combat diseases and parasites, to improve the health of the herds and the quality of the products derived from them.",1
They also work as rural administrators and planners of farms and rural facilities.,1
Cholesterol-free eggs and light pork are examples of what genetic research can do in search of healthier foods.,1
"Often confused with the veterinarian, the zootechnician is, in fact, the professional focused on the development of production.",1
"You traveled, you are far from me.",1
I can't stop thinking about you.,1
"Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to miss you.",1
"Ah! Honey, you are my better half.",1
"I kill time, writing in this online diary.",-1
I look forward to waiting for you.,1
Only you make me smile.,1
I want your strong hug soon.,1
"Is it just me who never had a cute, perfect boyfriend even for just a month?",-1
In my love life everything sucks.,1
"When the guy is interested in me sometimes I'm not interested in the guy or everyone is interested and it doesn't work out, something happens and that's it.",-1
"I know I should wait, but I waited too long.",1
"This is the first record I've made here, and at the moment there's not much to talk about my personal life, so I'm going to reproduce something I wrote in a message.",1
"Stay there and I'll stay here with my breasts, with firm, protruding nipples, eager to be licked from top to bottom, from side to side, to be bitten lightly and sucked all over.",1
"Nozzles that can be tender like breasts, which are swollen and proud to be so cute.",1
"These breasts that won't fit inside a hand, spread out between the fingers, which you hope to squeeze them firmly, fingers that enter through the bra, appearing through the malicious neckline of the red blouse, and inside the bra squeeze them gently, delicately, touching and pulling out everything that burns and throbs strongly inside.",-1
" Soft, gluttonous, warm mouth that will try to swallow him whole and won't be able to, will lick him completely to compensate for the fact that he can't touch him completely with his mouth.",1
"Hands enveloping them while your mouth doesn't stop licking them like ice cream, because they almost melt in your mouth.",-1
"And those nipples get harder and harder, causing an impatient, nervous, wet-getting excitement.",1
"My heart races, my hands are cold and a little trembling, it gives me butterflies in my stomach, and a strange feeling when he's around, and especially when we're alone, or even in a crowd, when he calls me hugs and says: ""you look beautiful today"".",1
"At that moment I feel awkward, and shyness takes over me and when I realize it, I'm already in his arms.",-1
"I already forget completely where I am, and I stop caring about the people around me, when I'm with him, it's like there's only exists the two of us there.",-1
I think having a romance is much cooler than just a bid.,1
"Romance is for an indefinite period, while bidding has limited times.",1
"I am enjoying loving and being loved, the best thing is to be reciprocated with good feelings.",1
"May it be eternal while it lasts, and may it last forever.",1
"FOR YOU, I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE, I WISH YOU ALL GOOD FEELINGS, ALL GOOD COMPANION",1
"MAY THE LOVE OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE WILLING TO KNOWLEDGE BE YOUR ""MARK"" IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ILLUMINATED SPIRIT.",1
"MAY YOU BRING WITH YOU LOVE, WISDOM, PEACE, CALM AND THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE.",1
"THAT YOU TEACH ME TO BE MORE HUMAN AND THE TRUE MEANING OF LOVE, SINCE NOW FORGIVE ME FOR MY EXCESSES TOWARDS YOU, BUT MAY THIS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND MAY GOD HELP US TO BE EVERY DAY "" MOTHER AND SON"" LET MY BELOVED SON COME.",1
"I remember so many moments, so many good things that we did together, you were an angel to me.",1
"I don't even remember exactly how I met you but I know it was the best day of my life, you for me are more than a friend, you are a sister from a different family.",1
You don't know how bad I felt about you changing schools.,-1
I want you to do well in life and to love someone who also loves you very much.,1
Agent is starting to walk away and you didn't even notice.,1
"But know that I miss you a lot, I miss your smile.",-1
"Man, I can't take Douglas anymore, annoying boy!",-1
"Like, he disappeared, now he's back to bug me again.",-1
"I don't treat him badly, but man he just talks shit, I already said I don't want to be with him anymore, but he insisted in a way that suffocates.",-1
"I really wanted to have his friendship, but he always comes with second intentions, I'm about to put an end to it, that is to say, excluding him.",1
"And so, I was DISGUSTED by him, and even I don't understand why.",-1
He stuck his tongue down my throat in a way that I almost died.,-1
Just imagining us getting together makes me want to throw up.,1
Today I went out with some friends.,1
"I love them because they are so nice and fun, we love to laugh and joke around.",1
"On the way to this girl's house we found a gentleman lying on the ground as if he was dead or passed out, the strange thing was that the man had his eyes half open and turned upwards.",1
"I thought it was super strange and I was really scared, but we still passed the man and kept walking.",1
"My senses as a girl said something was wrong, so I asked lucar and victor to go back there with me and try to wake the man up to see if he was alive.",1
"But I wanted to go back anyway, so we went back.",1
"The boys tried to wake the man up in every way, nothing man woke up, so I decided to wake the guy up myself.",1
"I moved it, shook it, turned it over and nothing made the man wake up, until when I saw a bottle near his head I decided to pick it up and pour the liquid that was inside it on the man's head, that's when he woke up.",1
My mom got into a big fight with me about sleep schedules.,-1
"Oh, the crybaby here spent the night crying until her eyes were swollen.",-1
"Thinking that the only way for my parents not to fight with me would be to die anyway, then it wouldn't bother anyone.",1
I took another antidepressant pill (I usually only take two) and went to listen to music.,1
"After a while, I was dancing happily, as if nothing had happened.",1
"And that was until 5 am, when I finally decided to go to sleep.",1
"And no, it wasn't the medicine, because it takes a long time to take effect, it doesn't happen overnight.",1
"Well, the important thing is that I'm better.",1
Today I made an appointment with the gynecologist.,1
"We've never had sex, but I think it's closer than far.",-1
"I'm a virgin, or at least I've never had penetration.",1
"The only thing we did was oral sex, he on me.",1
"Sometimes I feel a little bad for being so dependent on others, not knowing how to do anything on my own.",-1
"I envy my friends who take care of everything themselves, know how to go everywhere, and in a good way.",1
University timetables were terrible.,-1
" She keeps throwing it in my face that I don't know how to do anything, and then I get it in my head, and it makes me even more impotent.",1
I fought with him and I deleted everything but the other week I saw more and more porn cartoons.,-1
"Oh guys, I don't like that, I don't know, I think it's a lack of respect for me!",-1
But she is very special she is my best friend.,1
"With the end of my college term, I felt terrible.",-1
"It was a seminar, a test and work all together, I was about to go crazy, especially since I hate public speaking.",-1
"I have no way, I stutter, I forget, the hell.",-1
"There was a subject that I reached the limit of absences: another that I spent fishing: there was a work that I didn't even see the color of, but they put my name: in the seminars I saved myself because of the others..",1
"There was one that at the last minute I gave up and started crying, but I talked to the teacher and she gave me a huge alternative work, so I wouldn't be left with zero.",-1
I feel super bad that everyone performs well and I perform poorly.,1
"As it is public, the level is very high.",-1
And my inferiority complex only increases in these cases.,1
My psychologist asked me if I wanted a second opinion (both to see about the medication issue and to see if I really had BPD-borderline personality) and I agreed.,1
I went to the psychiatrist and she gave me risperidone.,0
"I decided to accept it, because I was really terrible (I still am, but at least now that I went on vacation, I'm relieved).",-1
"I've always been a perfectionist, I always like to give my best, especially in terms of intellectual performance.",1
I want to make up for what my college roommates did for me.,1
"In a little while, no one will want to invite me to groups anymore, if I continue to be this bad.",-1
"I want to drive a car, be independent, be a successful psychologist.",1
At least the college subjects will be nicer and more in line with the course.,1
Saturday the 28th of July was a wonderful Saturday.,1
"I met a guy, kind, handsome and funny.",1
"Maybe I met him two or more weeks ago, I don't remember.",-1
But I remember perfectly when he told me he liked me a lot.,1
I wasn't surprised and nothing special.,-1
I was already used to knowing that many boys already declared it to me.,-1
Worse is that I liked him too.,-1
"You might think I'm crazy, I liked a boy I met on the internet.",-1
"I'm tired of chasing after people who don't deserve it, now if you want them to come after me, you know where to look for me and where to find me.",-1
"They don't think like girls. So don't treat them like ""friends"".",-1
"Men are naturally territorial, they are jealous and hunters!",1
"It was just a blink of an eye, and I fell in love at last, and in the middle of the smoke, he likes me too.",1
Yes I'm a valley girl!,1
"I'm a proud person, I don't make out with everyone (because that's a bitch thing), I play ball, I talk to those who talk to me, I don't have many friends either!",1
My school is full of rockers and the preppy ones they had there usually turned into sluts!,1
I am one of the only self-respecting preppy girls who enjoy reading and who are not examples of whores.,1
"Last Carnival there was a celebration at the school, all the classes were together, I preferred to go read a book in the library, there was the music teacher and about three rocker students too.",1
" I went in, excused myself and went to get a novel!",1
There was a boy who kept looking at me and it was bothering me.,-1
I don't consider myself a lucky person.,-1
I don't consider myself a person with feelings either.,-1
But the biggest one is hate.,-1
"Many think that I am wrong, and that I am talking a lot of nonsense, when I say that there is a great hatred present in me.",-1
"But these people are just countless mortals who say whatever they want, literally, they don't know anything about me, much less about what I think.",-1
"Not that I consider myself an immortal, for me, everyone has the same fate.",1
"But lately, strange things have been happening to me.",-1
My family never cared what happens or doesn't happen to me.,1
"By the way, no one ever cared to even know if I was okay, or if I needed help.",1
Nobody ever cared about me.,-1
"Love letters don't usually start like this, with explanations and reasons.",1
But there would be no other way to write something I feel without trying to explain or give reasons even though loving exempts any kind of explanation and does not require reasons to happen.,1
"I think love arises I don't know where, grows I don't know why and accidentally hurts you maybe it's my only hope... or the last.",1
"Not because I can't fall in love again but because whenever I desire someone, that person will be you!",-1
That will be in my dreams you are different!,-1
"You are the only one responsible for what I feel. I give myself completely to you, if you want I can give your name to a star or give this star to you.",1
"I can try to stop the wind or sit in the spring breeze I can try to stop the sun or make sure you have a perfect day I can try and do so many things for you, unless you love me as much as I LOVE YOU.",1
"It's good if loving is thinking about you 24 hours a day, going out on the street thinking that I can cross you at any moment and close my eyes and see your face, it might even be love!",1
And every day I will look at the sky and thank you for having found you and for being more than I expected I will thank you for your gaze.,1
"In that terrible state of depression that I found myself in, I didn't know what else to do I was so desperate, I felt inconsolable pain, it hurt a lot, more than anything, or almost anything.",-1
"I found a solution, or rather, in my head it was the only solution.",1
I started slitting my wrists in order to bring physical pain and forget the emotional pain.,-1
"Incredibly, that made me stronger.",1
"My friend Laura, the dumbest and dumbest of them all, started cutting herself in the middle of the classroom.",-1
"FUCKING AGAIN, she was called in the board, she gave the names of everyone who was in the game, and they were all called, one by one as if it were at the police station.",-1
"Then they found out that we had all cut ourselves, they thought we had made some kind of pact.. they called our parents, but only Laura's and my mother's who went there and found out about it.",1
"My weekend was okay, let's just say I expected a little more.",1
"Last night my boyfriend came to the house, we didn't go out, we stayed at home anyway.",-1
And as always there was another DR.,0
"But this time it was nice, we talked a lot, I think he understood my side.",1
I actually think I was able to express clearly what I was feeling.,1
"It was cool, after a lot of talking we ended up dating, amazing how that boy has the gift of driving me crazy and at the same time making me happy.",1
The moments with you are always so perfect you know.,1
"When you kiss me it's like a million lights shine in my world, I feel like I'm floating in your arms.",1
When you hug me I feel protected.,1
As if no external problems could reach us!,-1
I'm sure it's called LOVE.,1
And it's amazing how this feeling makes me feel good and bad at the same time.,1
"Today I felt very lonely and instead of crying, as usual, I self-harmed.",-1
"I hit myself a lot, and bit myself 3 times.",-1
"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but I can't think on anything else to do when I'm sad, cause my friends and family don't understand that I'm sad for no reason and they'll call me an dumb and if I tell anyone that I self-harmed they will call me sick, because that's what human beings do, they judge each other.",-1
Life was freely given to us.,1
The power of reaction is within each of us.,1
There is no magic potion to be happy.,1
"You only need to have a clean soul, without hurts and grudges.",1
Each one is free to fulfill his mission the way he wants.,1
"Happiness is always knocking on our door, just open it and invite it in.",1
We will always have enlightened souls reaching out to us.,1
"Alive, happy and communicative, these Gemini beings, light and relaxed, seem to be always on good terms with everyone.",1
"Friendly as they are, they will always give the impression that they are interested in someone, but they are just chatting and looking for information.",-1
"Geminis are always very expressive and talk a lot with their hands, always telling facts that happened to them very vividly",1
"Their walk is kind of bouncy and happy, and they are always multitasking, like studying while watching TV and talking on the phone while talking to you.",1
"Indeed, It's not really that they're following fashion: they're always in fashion.",1
"I'm well organized, paranoid, i have disgust of almost everything.",1
"I love children, and sometimes I look a lot like them, I love playing, jumping, in short... mess, I love happy and different things.",-1
"The truth is, I'm too intense and there's no one to fix it.",-1
I vibrate with joys that do not belong to me.,1
"The good thing is, every night before I go to sleep, I pray.",1
And I always smile!,1
Longing is the best proof that the past was worth it.,-1
"Really, I don't have the energy to get ready, to take care of myself, bad thoughts take over my head and I fall into a state of despair.",-1
"I lent the money to my father and honestly, I regret it a lot.",1
"Diego sent me away, he didn't want to know me anymore, my mother turned her back on me, I only had my father and he asked me to withdraw the money from the bank, putting the greatest psychological pressure, I didn't would you take it?",-1
"Well, now it's no different, because anyway he's with me out of pity.",1
"Now I'm here with all my cards having to be paid in installments (I'll pay triple the amount due to the interest), without a penny and on top of that with Diego fighting with me and throwing it in my face every day that I'm stupid and I lent the money to my father.",-1
"He doesn't understand why he never had to go through a hardship like this, but I'm sure if it was his mother instead of my father, he would have done the same.",1
"Diego, in turn, instead of being a present boyfriend, who supports me, who advises me and who tries to understand my side and help me, only knows how to judge me and fight with me because of it.",1
"Yesterday, I was with my best friend in class, I arrived late and I had a little chat with my best friend.",1
Here comes that crazy girl I told you about that day that I made fun of her and that she wouldn't let me talk to my best friend.,-1
The crazy girl talked to her and I didn't even understand their conversation but I ended up keeping quiet.,-1
Portuguese class was boring.,-1
"Hours passed, we went to the video room, it was physical education class, what the hell!",1
I wanted to go to the gym but the teacher wanted us to stay in the video room and watch the boring movie.,1
"You promised me, I know, I remember, you swore it would be forever.",1
"You also swore that you would forgive my mistakes and my shortcomings, that any slip that I had, you would forgive, because the good you had done to him would overcome any pain.",1
"Forgive me, I made unforgivable mistakes, just as I have already forgiven, I made exaggerated slips, and it wasn't the first time, I lied for fear of your reaction, for fear that you would abandon me, I fought so hard by your side from this fear, which was of no use to me, fear only made me lose you.",-1
" I can no longer hide the sadness, and tears have already filled my eyes.",1
"I'm without ground, aimless, without dreams.",-1
"I find myself empty, hopeless and after everything I've done to you, I don't have the courage to ask you to stay with me.",-1
"I love you so much, I wanted you to know that, for you to realize my acts of love, affection, dedication that I showed you.",1
I think about the future because it will be good for me and everyone I love.,1
"I'm going to graduate, work I'll do my best to keep the peace in my house.",1
I don't intend to commit seriously to anyone.,-1
"We think differently, we have different goals.",-1
"I come from a family where the Father always supported the house to raise the children, while my mother stayed at home taking care of us.",1
"We didn't have everything, but the essentials to become responsible adults!",1
"I have a lot of friends, I'm an extroverted, happy person, I love to see people happy around me, I really value Health, because if we have it, we'll chase the rest.",1
"But my husband is Materialistic, Grumpy, I say almost Bi POLAR, a good father yes, but not a good husband.",-1
"He doesn't have many friends, and ends up being selfish many times, if he needs to, he goes over someone to gain something.",-1
"For me the simplest things in life are the best, I love visitors.",1
And making someone happy is worth more than knowing about my life.,1
"I am very happy with the approval, even though I know it was not really deserved.",1
"But this time everything ended well, after so much pain and suffering from the circumstances, everything ended well.",-1
"And it affected me so much, I was totally mad.",1
I still remember the sweet words you said.,1
"I remember the smile you had when you saw me, the explanations you gave when you couldn't call.",1
"I still remember the times you looked at me and said how much you loved me, how much you wanted me.",1
I still remember the times you looked at me and said how scared you were of losing me.,-1
I still remember how much satisfaction I got from seeing you smile.,1
"I still remember everything I lived with you, and I miss those nights when you told me your joys and agonies.",-1
"I've been remembering those conversations, our laughs and also our secrets.",1
"I always remember that smile of his, when I arrived sad, I felt hugged by him.",1
"And I remember too, how you managed to ease my pain.",1
"What a desire to go back in time, have you by my side, with your eyes lit up.",1
"I kept them all in my memory, I will never forget them.",1
"Our paths changed, but they didn't get lost: I'm still here, and best of all, I'm sure you're still there too.",1
"If you need to, look for me: if you miss me, call: if you have a problem, count on me: and if you have time, let's see each other !",1
"I don't look so young anymore, but my heart is still the same that loved you, that gave you affection, and loved receiving yours.",1
"Maybe we'll see each other tomorrow, maybe we won't see each other for a year, maybe even time will push us further apart, but I want you to know that today I remembered you.",1
"I promise to love you until the end of my life, until my last breath, until the last beat of my heart, until the last tear of my face.",1
"Because now I know that it is you that my heart really chose, that it is you that I will fight for until infinity and I will wish for at all times in all dreams in all desires in all my prayers.",-1
"I feel this desire every day, you know, even when I do, but hours later I already feel like making good love.",1
"My guardian angel named Douglas, besides being beautiful, was my best friend!",1
For friends also say I LOVE YOU!,1
I can't think of him without laughing!,-1
"He called all the boys I told him to be a friend an idiot, he wasn't a boring friend, he stayed on my toes but he never let me do anything wrong!",-1
"He was, and will always be my best friend, because he is not visible, but he is alive in my heart!",1
"This is a place where many people can vent and I feel a bit ""great mom"" from many who write, because I'm older than most of the girls here.",-1
"Most of those who threaten to do it, don't, but if you're wondering, I have a report to give.",1
A colleague of mine killed herself before she was 30!,1
It was a fright for many people.,-1
she separated from her husband and couldn't stand it!,1
At 5 years old I almost died!,-1
I had appendicitis with serious complications.,1
It's actually a miracle that I'm alive.,1
And it will be selfish of you to let others sort it out.,-1
I can't see a hot blonde in front of me that I'm already turned on!,1
" So I don't know what else to do, hand myself over to death or wait a little longer?",-1
Indirects affect my bad mood and only make you more disgusting to me.,-1
"Me and my boyfriend now, we've been spending a lot of time together, and we still have that dream of sleeping together, and waking up next to each other, you know.",1
And he still eats you WITH FOOTPRINT and then licks his lips of how good it was.,1
"It was all so intense, a month felt like years.",1
"After many tears and a farewell party my vacation was over, I came back to my reality and then my summer romance had to come to an end due to real world responsibilities.",1
I feel like a part of me is somewhere else.,0
Looking forward to a tight hug and forehead kiss.,1
" My mind says it's crazy to wait so long, but my heart says it's possible.",1
Today I missed everyone and the place where I stayed.,-1
"Almost two months made me have a routine, pretty crazy but a nice routine.",1
I believe that because of that this vacation was perfect.,1
It was a gift from heaven.,1
"Traveling with friends, with no family around was the best thing I've ever done.",1
I really miss this freedom right now.,1
This story is about relationships between women.,1
"I woke up late, with that urge to stay in bed, that urge to do nothing, just vegetate!",-1
"I hate feeling lazy, I keep blaming myself for not enjoying the world when I'm doing nothing, but these last few weeks I feel like I just want to sleep and forget about the world around me.",1
"My car that I would like to buy will have to wait after all, I didn't know that things for the house were so expensive, everything seemed like a dream or rather a nightmare.",-1
"When I got there, Helen welcomed me with a smile, but something in her eyes was different, then she told me that Erika was there with a friend dismantling the furniture.",-1
As soon as you get up Erika will look at you with those disapproving eyes.,-1
"At nightfall we headed to the hotel closest to the house, with a good appearance, I felt more comfortable spending the night.",-1
"We went upstairs and entered room 42, a mirror in front, a large bathroom with antique ceramics, a huge bed in the bedroom, the atmosphere was similar to a motel, but a little less daring.",-1
"She took off her blouse towards the bathroom, I kept looking at her curves, she wasn't thin but she wasn't overweight either, when I heard the shower turn on I felt my body warmer, I knew it was the first symptoms that my body was excited.",-1
"I went into the bathroom and took off my clothes, looking into her eyes I asked if I could come in, she nodded with a malicious smile and made a yes gesture, ran her hand over my body.",1
"We woke up very early, went back to her house, the truck would arrive soon to take the move, she had taken on a big responsibility.",1
"Seeing all those bags packed, I realized what I was doing and that it really was a madness that I was starting to enjoy.",-1
"I had already loved someone who never loved me, I did everything for my ex, and from one day to the next she left me, it hurts too much to love and have to live on crumbs, and in this short life of mine I have already suffered too much, so why not match Helen?",1
"Why not make her happy, since she was willing to make me happy too.",1
"Now with a more open heart, I drove the truck towards the new house, after thirty minutes we were close.",1
"Life was cruel to me, since I was a little girl, already working as a shoeshine boy, going hungry and seeing everyone with a father and mother, and I was an orphan with living parents.",-1
"I realized that there was almost no sun, and that the biggest difficulty would be the clothes, I realized that Helen was not happy, but I knew I would help her, my money was already running out, she with the dirty and swamped name of accounts couldn't help me so soon.",-1
Barely started and the financial problems started.,-1
"Maturity knocked on my door early, I had to put food on the table early.",1
"While I have the strength to fight, I think that's why I got a good job early on, I relate very well with people, of course the beauty of being of Indian descent with Italian makes the difference.",1
"That night I slept with her, the fights at my house were constant, I couldn't participate in my classes, I was distant from my family, and to help my mother and I we fought a lot.",-1
"I went back to live with her when I was 11 years old when I was abandoned by my aunt, our relationship was very difficult, she repeated a million times that I was not her daughter, that I was a mistake that happened.",-1
"Until I couldn't take it anymore and started to fight head on, I left home aimlessly, many times, and for the first time at age twelve I knew what depression was.",-1
"My mother called saying a lot, that I was irresponsible and that things couldn't stay like this.",-1
"Our first weekend arrived, I did the market, I prepared lunch, I did the laundry, wow, everything was so delicious, and she was so happy, despite everything she always told me that she was happy, and asked for all the days until I marry her.",-1
"I just remember hearing the phone hang up, I knew I had lost my family at that moment.",1
"That day in the morning was torturous, I knew my mother would talk a lot, she explodes out of nowhere and doesn't stop, when she fights with my father she almost hits him.",-1
"In this moment I felt my life end, my heart was breaking into a billion pieces, everything I've conquered to ask for, everything I once was was no more, tears were streaming down my face.",-1
"I felt angry with myself, with letting go of everything for someone else, with letting her talk to me like that, talking about her like that.",-1
"I went back to work listening only to her torments, trying to hide my crying face, but deep down, I was more lost than a whore in an agreement.",1
"The six hour hand struck, and the taxi was waiting for me, I went inside the house again, hoping that everything was a dream.",1
"I wanted to die, I couldn't name what I was feeling, it was a mixture of fear, despair, and an enormous feeling of loneliness, I've always been lonely.",-1
"Wow, you look so thin and pretty. Let's go shopping for pants, I always do that with your sister, I think we can do that.",1
"It was wonderful, perfect, for a moment I got the attention my sister had effortlessly.",1
"Now after three years I find myself in front of the toilet, I didn't do any kind of force, I just threw up like the old days.",-1
"I couldn't answer, I didn't cry, I didn't smile, I just sat on the bathroom floor looking at nothing, with an eternal sense of well-being in the midst of the emptiness that tormented me.",-1
"I woke up with Helen looking at me, I knew she wasn't well either, but at that moment she was the only person I had and I was the only person she had, I took a shower, changed and was already leaving.",1
"Everything will be fine! I'll arrive earlier today, I'll prepare the pasta you like so much, would you like something to drink, you slept without eating anything.",1
"During the day, I could see my brother through the window, a handsome blond boy, we are much more than brothers, we share a secret, he is my accomplice and I am his.",1
"And so another month went by, I didn't eat, I didn't live, I vegetated, and at the end of the day I threw up, Helen locked herself in the world of bills using my card, she didn't care about anything anymore either.",-1
"My uncle was returning from Paraná where my aunt who raised me lived, asked to talk to me about a very sensitive matter.",1
Evening was approaching when I heard the knock on the door.,1
"Of course, I came back from my trip because I would like to know how this is, I have bad news about your aunt.",1
"You will always be that little girl with blonde hair and a smile on the most beautiful face in the universe, I love you, don't forget.",1
"I closed the door, Helen looked at me scared, I didn't say anything I just went to the bathroom, turned on the shower, got in with my clothes and everything, the tears mixed with the shower water, the door opens.",1
"I can't, my life is over, I don't know what to do.",0
"The following week it was raining a lot, I woke up during the night scared, the house was full of water, at the height of the bed.",1
"In a few minutes, Helen came in a way she had never seen, it was true, it was much more than just sex.",1
"After this experience, she wanted me to be a man in bed every time, and soon I started to question why these attitudes.",1
"Two days after the flood I started having severe muscle pain, and the fever was not constant, seven days passed, I went to work my eye was huge, I thought I had conjunctivitis, I asked for leave from work, and when I was leaving I had a big surprise, it was my sister looking at me.",1
"My God, that's why you're so red I think you have a fever, but why don't you go to the convention?",1
"He gave me a big hug, a kiss and told me he loved me, I smiled.",1
"Everyone in the room, including my father, stood up, concern was visible on everyone's faces.",-1
There I was able to get closer to my family and to get Helena closer too.,1
"I have everything a little teenager can have, friends, people who love me, ""money"", popularity, I have everything.",1
"I don't have the touch of your hand sliding over my body, I don't have your hugs, I don't have your kisses, I don't have you in my life.",-1
"I do everything in my power because for my life to be perfect, all you need is you.",1
Wow today I'm ashamed and much more I HATE myself.,-1
"You know today when I was leaving the garage at home I accidentally spilled the car and scratched it on the back, wow I feel like crap.",1
And my husband saw it and called me out and with good reason as I am very distracted and STUPID for doing this and I admit I am wrong and I am most ashamed of him and myself for having done this this.,-1
I know it was by accident but I have an obligation to pay a little more attention.,-1
I really want to hit myself because I hate myself so much.,-1
I had a wonderful evening with my husband yesterday.,1
It won't be difficult for me to write this guide.,1
"When you fall in love with a shy girl, know that she might be too but she will never take the initiative even to look you in the eye.",1
"So, you'll have to go there and talk to her, anything, usually just say ""Hi"" then ""How are you?"" and bring up an interesting subject, nothing too personal.",1
"If the two of you end up getting along talking well, this will probably be a sign that she is enjoying talking and thinks you are a nice person, this is very important for everything to work out.",1
"So, if you don't see each other anymore, call her and ask her out so you two can talk.",1
"She might even be a bit embarrassed, but if their conversation had been pleasant for her, she will surely accept the invitation:",1
"Don't be quiet during the date, it will keep her quiet too and if she feels like saying something to you, she might get embarrassed and stay quiet, so always be bringing up good conversations.",-1
"When asking her on a date, don't play hard to get that it doesn't work with shy girls, be direct, talk to her getting exactly to the important point.",-1
"Once she finally accepts, all red with embarrassment, here's a tip, never let her feel pressured by you, if someone makes a bad joke that might make her feel bad, defend her right away, always bring up grievous subjects, I repeat.",1
"I'm sorry I didn't take good care of you, little one.",1
I used to think that such trivial things were more important.,-1
Sorry for making such a huge and unforgivable mistake.,-1
"I was such an idiot, to value after losing.",-1
"But I still know that if I were to just play with you like always, you'd forget about everything, and cheer me up like you always did.",1
Remember that Christmas I spent alone?,1
" My father preferred my stepmother to me (although I was already used to it, it was the first time he had done that).",1
You were there for me when I needed it.,0
"You licked my tears, and slept next to me whenever I cried myself to sleep.",-1
"On Easter, there we were, the same year, home alone again.",1
"You were always there when I needed you, yes I feel I must repeat that.",1
How many people are really worth knowing and are your real friends?,1
"When my parents divorced, I had nothing left.",-1
"I think I was old enough to be eight or nine, honestly.",-1
"Only you knew that I didn't cry because I was alone on those dates we used to celebrate, but I cried because my father was all I had left, and I was simply his second choice.",1
So I'm left with you.,0
"You were just stolen from me, weren't you?",-1
"I knew you were gone somehow, but I wanted to avoid it, I wanted to lie to myself.",-1
"The truth hurts, it always hurt",-1
" Then my dad just came up and said something like ""You heartless person, didn't you notice that your dog is no longer there, that he was stolen?"".",-1
"Even so, I looked for you at that time.",0
I looked like never before.,0
"I looked everywhere in the yard, and I went out in my pajamas looking for you.",1
"At night, I cried.",-1
"I cried more than at Christmas and Easter, I swear I cried.",-1
"I don't know how it was possible, but I cried for six hours straight.",-1
"It didn't make matters any better for my father to see me crying and start screaming ""stop crying, you're so childish"" and scold me, call me names.",-1
"I just thought ""Can't he see I just lost everything I had?""",-1
I felt like the most groundless person in the world.,-1
"Thank you dog for being there while I was being bullied and anorexic over stupid, trite comments that wouldn't have changed my life if I didn't care.",-1
"Thank you for being there when I thought about committing suicide, I looked at you, and I thought ""I have to stay to take care of you.""",1
"Nobody believes, and some even laugh, when I say that my dog was everything and nothing to me, and that he saved me from suicide, but I think that reading this text, some would understand.",1
"I still spend every Christmas since then alone, and Easter too.",1
"Not on purpose, the whole family simply forgets about my existence.",1
"My mom won't even let me go out with her, and she takes my sister, and then she still complains that she's the ""unloved"" in the story.",-1
"Well, these days, I always miss you.",-1
"I regret crying before having you by my side, and now I feel that I have real reasons to be like this.",1
Thank you for changing my life and saving it.,1
"Honestly, without you, I would be dead already.",-1
"This is a phrase I usually say to someone who asks about my life, but no one understands.",-1
There are few that I explain myself to.,1
"It has to be for someone who really deserves the story, and has the patience to listen to it.",1
"Now I am sustained by memories, you know?",-1
"Not having you anymore, I guess that's all I have left.",0
I can't hang on to friends I know won't be with me like they say they will.,-1
"I hold on to memories because many of them don't come back, many people have changed, but the memories don't.",1
"When I looked back, he barked, wagged his tail and did a sexy pose that seduced me, I want him.",-1
"I don't know if you remember this, dog, but I do.",-1
"I don't know if you're alive, but I know that wherever you are, you're in my heart, and I'm with you little one.",1
"That promise I made you that Christmas, and I held you tight.",1
"I still have your collar, your food bowls, everything that belonged to you.",-1
"I dare not throw any of that away, because that's what I have left of you, isn't it?",1
Maybe I'll donate it to some dog that needs some love.,1
It would be mean to miss one while I have it and I just don't notice it because I'm attached to it.,1
"It's in the heart and soul, and I know you look out for me, little one.",1
The boyfriend is not mine.,0
"Well, for a long time I wanted to vent what I THINK about the BOYFRIEND of a FRIEND, one of my CLOSEST friends.",1
"I've already said some things to her, but it's complicated to talk about someone else's boyfriend, right?",-1
"She has been dating for almost 4 years, she broke up once, but not for long.",1
They live in different but close cities.,-1
And he doesn't care if her parents don't like it.,-1
He doesn't care about anything.,-1
"He's 20 years old, didn't finish high school (DUE TO LAZINESS), DOESN'T WORK, and is a gym fanatic.",-1
"Anywhere they go, the bill is ALWAYS split, evenly between the two.",-1
She can't go online when he's at her house (except VERY FAST) because she has to be ALONG WITH HIM.,1
"She can't go out here without him, just stay home!",-1
"I've never dated long distance, but I don't think it would be easy!",1
He turns off his cell phone at dawn and the next day says the battery is dead.,1
"he leaves at dawn and says he went to buy a ""pastel"" "".""",1
"The funny thing is that he almost never has money to spend with my friend, he always has to share it, but with BRAND NEW CLOTHES, SNEAKERS AND the gym he always has!",1
"The funny thing is that he almost never has money to spend with my friend, he always has to share it, but with BRAND NEW CLOTHES, SNEAKERS AND the gym he always has!",1
 She herself has already said that he is super MATERIALIST and cares a lot about himself.,1
"They don't trust each other, she clearly told me she doesn't!",-1
"Last night when I got home from the course and was going to have dinner I felt one of those pains that I always feel in my leg my leg paralyzed Fernanda took me to the living room my father was having dinner, when I went to the living room I started to shake and feeling dizzy and ringing in the ears followed by numbness in the hands.",-1
"Nanda called SAMU but it didn't help much they couldn't come, but my father took me to the UPA there I attended quickly the doctor didn't know what I had and he prescribed me a medicine to stop the medicine was given intravenously, that is, I would have to take it together with a drip.",1
"Hence my panic I couldn't take the medicine I was very nervous and scared, my father didn't understand the phobia I have of needles and fought with me in front of the nurses.",-1
My father held me by the arm and wanted to take me to take the medicine. ,0
I came home my father scolded me only my sister understood what I was feeling I cried almost the whole night.,1
I suffered a lot for not being able to take the medicine and I suffered even more for the brutality of my parents for not understanding that people with phobias are not frills.,-1
"I argued with my older sister yesterday, she is very annoying and stuck up.",-1
Yesterday she was at work and my cousin said she had chocolate and I'm crazy about chocolate.,1
"Well, today I start writing my virtual diary, since I don't have a single friend to listen to me when I need to.",1
"My name is Edvania Lemos, I am married and have a 12 year old son.",1
I got married early and I don't think it was a good choice.,1
When we are young and fall in love we see everything in a fantasy way and full of good things and then we throw ourselves body and soul into the life we think is perfect.,1
"Anyway, this is how my dilemma begins, I had a boyfriend when I was 14 and I stayed with him until I was 16. I got pregnant and everything went downhill from there.",1
I was very nauseous and my poor boyfriend was the one who got the most nauseous and that's why we parted ways and with only 4 months pregnant we literally went our separate ways.,-1
"They were wonderful to me, they supported me and helped me in everything.",1
But out of conscience I decided to support my son myself.,1
"Well when my son was 5 months old I met a friend of my sister, at first it was a friendship but in less than 15 days we had our 1st kiss and wow what a delicious kiss it was passion for sure.",1
"He immediately took care of me and my son who was still a baby, and everything was perfect!",1
Wow he was very kind and passionate he took care of my son and me like a real man he literally assumed it seems my son was his biological son a perfect father as everyone should be.,1
"We dated until my son was a year old, then we got married, bought our house and started a life together.",1
"Everything was going well he was in the army he didn't earn much but it was enough, with 2 years of marriage he was promoted to sergeant and of course everything got much better financially.",1
The sex wasn't so good anymore and my husband was very silent and quiet with me.,1
With regard to our son he has not changed at all he has always fulfilled the role he assumed perfectly a great father I would never complain about that.,1
One afternoon he came in telling me he had to go to an event at the barracks.,1
"he was even irritated because he said he didn't feel like going, but he said he had to.",1
"Like the good wife I've always been, I put on his best uniform, I shined his boots, I left him beautiful and fragrant, he kissed me and left.",1
He arrived at 00:30 and I was waiting for him anxiously because we always slept together and that's why I was waiting for him.,-1
"When he came in it was strange he went straight to take a shower not even a kiss as usual, it was strange but we made love and slept.",1
"This happened on Wednesday night, and on Sunday I was making lunch and my husband was watching football with my son.",0
"Then someone clapped at the gate that would be where my life would fall apart, it was a man and my husband went to answer it and wow he was pale nervous I didn't understand why, and I stayed at the door how great was my disappointment and anguish.",-1
"Hello, who has never suffered for love or passion?",1
"I think most won't even respond, just because they've had such a bad experience with these.",-1
There are so many good and bad situations involving love and passion that there is no way to describe them all.,1
I've liked a boy for almost three years.,1
"Within that time (which is not short), I've had good times and bad (more bad) and I can't seem to get out of this!",-1
"Even when that someone gives you proof that he is not interested, you keep finding ways to reverse it.",-1
"When he makes it clear he DOESN'T LIKE YOU, you cry or/and are sad for a few days, but then you think of some way to make him see how special you are.",1
"After once again having proof that this someone doesn't want me, I decided that I'm going to forget him.",1
"Nobody deserves to humiliate themselves, cry, in the end, suffer for a person who doesn't appreciate or doesn't want to receive their FEELINGS.",-1
"this is the advice I leave for you: VALUE YOURSELF, EVERYONE HAS A SOUL MATTER!",1
"My love and I, we were born for each other. All we need is someone to introduce us.",1
I'm upset and disappointed.,-1
My mother assumed that she was prejudiced against my boyfriend because he was black.,-1
"I told her it doesn't matter to me, but I feel like she doesn't support my dating.",-1
Like everything was really cool really cool,1
I decided to cut my bangs.,1
Except the idiot hairdresser got it wrong.,-1
And cut my bangs halfway across my forehead and crooked.,-1
We place so much trust and so much feeling in people.,1
"In people we thought we knew, but who, in the end, only turned out to be the same as everyone else.",0
"And because we expect too much, dream too much, create too many expectations, we always end up disappointing ourselves and hurting ourselves more and more.",1
Attitude of a fool in love.,-1
"But I really thought it would all work out, that by opening my heart you would, I don't know, say you felt the same way, I swear I thought it was going to be like this.",1
"In my dreams I imagined your mouth saying the words that would make me happy, that from that day on it would be you and me forever.",1
But that didn't happen and nowadays we're not even friends anymore a friendship of more than five years ended like this.,-1
"But between being your friend or an acquaintance I prefer a thousand times to be your friend I miss our chats, laughs, jokes I miss you in my life!",1
"I wanted to share with you about my relationship, and say what many have already told me.",1
"I met my boyfriend on my 19th birthday, we were taking a technical course at the same technical school, and a mutual friend introduced us.",1
"Since I had already broken up in another relationship (in fact, in almost all of them) I didn't pay much attention, but then I got to know him better and started to like him.",1
"Currently I'm 20 years old, and he'll be 29 in April, I prefer older guys, I'm happy with him and that's what matters.",-1
"Once, I had less than 1 month of dating when my niece was born, and my boyfriend went to the hospital to meet her and enjoy and meet a part of my family, who adores him by the way.",1
"My mother took a picture of me with him, with my niece and with our friend (the one who introduced us) who works with him, she is 42 years old.",1
"Then my mother went home and I went to the course with my boyfriend and our friend, when I arrived, the mother told me that she had posted the photo on her orkut.",1
"Friend, I just saw a picture of Miih with her boyfriend on your orkut, don't get me wrong, but he must be a lot older than her""",-1
This person who posted this is 56 YEARS OLD AND WAS MARRIED AT THE TIME TO A 24 YEAR OLD GUY.,-1
I got POSSESSED!,1
"I almost curse that woman up and down, it's so disrespectful, who is she to criticize my boyfriend?",-1
"Nothing against it, of course, but people should see each other more, at least I think.",-1
"Then time passed, and I entered the federal college (today I study in a private one, a subject for later) and right away I made friends with the class.",1
A colleague took my phone and saw my picture with my boyfriend.,1
"My boyfriend doesn't seem to be that much older than me, but that bothers me, because love doesn't depend on age.",1
"If he was 50 years old and I loved him, I would take him with no problem",1
"I get upset, obviously these ridiculous comments don't affect my relationship, but I think human beings should be less indiscreet and more considerate of others.",-1
"Lately I fight with my mother EVERY day, we fight about everything, just yesterday I was fighting with my younger sister Bruna, for messing with my things, and my mother already fought with me.",-1
My mom says I'm too rebellious!,-1
But I think it's because I'm approaching adolescence and everyone is like that at that stage of life.,1
5 years without the person who matters most to me in this world.,-1
"5 years ago I lost my reason, my hope, I lost my will to live.",-1
"But unfortunately I don't have it, and I'm still alive, so I have to live, even without it.",-1
"I continue, for her and with her.",1
"I love her more than anything in this life, so I love my life.",1
"I must lift my head and follow, because I know that she really wants that, that I follow my dreams, that I be someone.",1
"And you can be sure, Mom, I will make you very proud.",1
"Did you know that the boy who will value you the most is the one who can't get to you, the one who looks at you and when you notice he lowers his head or smiles, who can't look you in the eye, and at the same time When talking to you, he smiles like a fool, and often ends up saying some irrelevant, rather idiotic things, but did you know that he does this because he wants to wipe a smile off your face?",1
"And because he's too shy to hit on you, it's shyness.",-1
Did you know that those boys who barely say hi have the truest words to say to you in your ear.,1
"They just hope one day they can say, one opportunity, one chance.",1
"So, why do you girl keep being interested in that boy who has the courage to approach you right away talking about your appearance, looking at your body and complimenting you trying to win you over for what you are on the outside.",1
"Because the same boy who has the courage to approach you, has enough courage to go talk to another girl minutes later, and repeat the same words to get where he wants to.",1
"While the shy boy spends hours rehearsing something to say when he sees you, and keeps remembering your smile, your look, even your way of speaking, your every expression.",1
"The boy who doesn't have the courage to approach you, has admired you from afar for a long time, and knows you much more than you think, and much more than the one with attitude claims to know.",-1
My friends found out why they grabbed me and took off my coat to see what I was hiding.,1
But I only have this way of expressing what I feel.,1
"Today I'm very calm, very calm.",1
"You know, I spent most of my life worrying about everything, angsty, sad and depressed.",-1
"I thought about following the rules, playing the good boy, worried about what others thought of me.",1
"Fuck you today, I don't care what you guys think about me, I don't care about your popularity, go tell a lie in the fucking house, not in my ear.",-1
I don't care about appearing to be the good son when you are a terrible mother.,-1
"Fuck family, I didn't ask to be born into this shit, want to talk bad, talk more later pay dick.",-1
"I don't care about your authority, if you are my boss, my mother or the president of Brazil, to talk to me you ask please and then say thank you very much.",1
"Don't speak loudly to me, no one speaks loudly to me.",1
My education depends on yours!,1
"I don't care about your car, your motorcycle or your wife, if I want, I'll run after it.",1
I want you to shove your envy and falsehood up your ass.,-1
"Don't preach to me about your god, I have my beliefs and I don't need a nigger I came to honk in my ear to preach things he doesn't even practice.",1
"Don't tell me that to serve God you have to be inside your damn church punching money up your thief pastor's ass, and fuck you if you think that's why I'm going to hell.",-1
"Don't talk about my religion, you bastards, who are you to find something, you bunch of shit, put the bible under your arm and think you're serving God, and at home you curse your mother, that's all thinks about money, has sex with his girlfriend.",1
"Fuck social rules, I don't need to be perfect for anyone, I'm happy the way I am!",1
"Suck it up for those who don't like me, do you think I depend on your friendship?",-1
"I don't need to explain where I'm going or what I'm going to do, I don't even care about your shitty life.",-1
"I don't care about anything, for anyone, fuck it, I'm happy the way I am!",-1
"Running down the street, coming home covered in dirt, games of hide and seek, police and robbers, tag.",-1
"I miss playing with dolls, watching chiquititas on tv, and listening to sandy and junior.",-1
"Playing camping at my grandfather's house, and the strange foods he made !",1
A time when you only went to school to play.,1
Playing food with the neighbors !,1
"Go to your best friend/brother's house just to watch tv, and take a bath in his 1000 liter pool.",1
Playing goal with my older brother.,1
"On rainy days or when I had a nightmare, run to my parents' bed, or sleep on the side of his bed and make my father sleep all night with his hand on top of me, if I couldn't sleep.",1
"My grandfather, teaching me my homework and trying to pull my loose tooth.",-1
School friendships were true.,1
Declarations of friendship and crazy drawings in the school notebook.,1
"It's enough to know how to live, to know how to be free, to love and be loved, to know how to do things and be happy !",1
"Those who despise small events will never make great discoveries, small moments change big routes.",-1
"Once again I'm here lamenting, I'm devastated, my husband he lied to me, he created a profile on facebook hidden from me, added several women, including ex-girlfriends.",-1
"I stayed up all night, I cried a lot, I thought even more, but I can't come to a conclusion and I want to drop everything and leave.",-1
Going back to live with my parents and erasing my history with him.,-1
"I'm just afraid of not being able to, of regretting it, I'm distressed not knowing what to think, I really wanted to vent to a friend but I don't have it.",-1
What he did to me was a betrayal and it hurts a lot.,-1
"Today my boyfriend is going for a birthday, he usually comes to my house every Saturday.",1
He is sad and I am sad.,-1
I actually didn't want to wake up today.,-1
"A lie kills, but doubt tortures.",-1
"My friends came to the house to have a pizza all-you-can-eat, very nice, I ate too much, we watched a movie, and they are sleeping here at the house now.",1
"I love my boyfriend, we've been through so much together and he is without a doubt the best boyfriend anyone could ask for.",1
"I've always been alone and it seems like I'm alone with each passing day, my head hurts and my tears can't stop.",-1
"These feelings started when I was 14(I think), I don't know what went wrong in my life.",1
"At 14, I saw my parents fight, several times my father left the house, my parents argued with me, and I came home, you know, running to my room to cry.",-1
"Nobody, not my parents or my brothers would ever know why I was crying.",-1
"And it's like that until today, suffering, fighting straight with my parents.",-1
"Today my life sucks, I feel so imperfectly weird a freak, I HATE MYSELF!",-1
"Why am I not pretty, why am I a fool, why am I not the way my mother wants me to be, not how my family wants me to be.",-1
"I hate it when I'm so good and people take advantage of it, I hate it, having to hide all my suffering and my pain and keep it in my heart, I HATE MY LIFE!",-1
" And My life will never and will never be something I can call a life, my friends(colleagues) seem to have a better life than mine, I don't want to have to hide that I'm suffering anymore.",1
"I'M SICK, and my family seems to see how I'm feeling, they only complain, fight with me, call me names and hit me, I'm getting so weak that I'm giving in to this feeling of pain.",-1
"I argued yesterday with my grandmother, my godmother because she didn't trust me to go to the bakery to buy bread, she told my grandfather to follow.",1
"That's enough, I can't take it anymore, I had an argument with my aunt today with my mother and I'm crying and it feels like I'm alone again and like I always have been.",-1
"My tears don't stop falling, and you know what comes to my mind, death.",-1
"I feel so alone and so hurt inside, my heart is broken it's shown in my eyes and I turn up the music so the neighbors don't hear my screams of pain, as if my world is collapsing.",-1
"I see that the rain falls according to my tears, I see that the day is horrible and I see the consequences on my body.",1
"Alone in a world where only false feelings matter, where everyone believes a lie for fear of admitting the truth, for fear that the truth is not what you expect.",-1
"Rodrigo my friend, he said he would come back to talk to me on msn, I consider him like a big brother to me.",1
"Ah, besides all the suffering I'm feeling right now, there's also because my parents don't want me to date such a special person, you know.",1
"I want to cling to you and never let go, feel your hands stroking my hair and say you love them again, hear your laugh.",-1
"My day was good, I woke up early, I helped my mom and dad to organize my little party, I picked up my friends, I ate a lot of barbecue and cake, we had a good time.",1
I called Nando all day to see if he would come to my party.,1
I got a little angry because he didn't answer my calls.,-1
"I then asked my mother to let us go to the movies, she let us, we cut the cake and went to the movies, we went to see the avengers, very cool.",1
I bought my book.,0
I looked at my cell phone as usual and saw a message there.,-1
"When I read this message I thought I'll call him and see how he's doing, and try to tell him what he wants to talk to me.",-1
We started the conversation and everything was fine until he said he was going to come back just to see if they let him lean on work or for him to sign the resignation letter.,1
"My heart broke into a million pieces, I started crying right away, he asked me not to cry, and said it's hard for him too.",-1
He's only doing this because he can't stand his mother anymore and that when they had a fight he took all his clothes and put them in a bag and made more mess with him.,-1
Today I woke up and saw your side of the bed empty.,-1
His scent is still there somehow in my imagination.,1
I would always close the window and fight you for keeping it open.,1
And now the window is always open like you always asked me and I didn't even notice.,1
I used to fight you for leaving the TV and lights on in several rooms.,1
And now they're all on and I didn't even notice.,-1
Your side of the locker is empty and I didn't fill it in.,-1
Your side of the shoe rack was full of shoes that never ended and I always complained about the clutter.,-1
In the bathroom your drawers are empty.,-1
The window does not have its dozens of shampoos.,1
There's something left in the closet and I don't know if it's yours.,0
It's a travel toothbrush that my mother may have forgotten when she came to take her stuff,1
I have countless pictures of you on my computer.,-1
I have tons of pictures of you with other people I hate.,-1
"I hate it not because they did something to me, but because you gave yourself to them.",1
"Despite all the hate, I miss you.",1
Holidays or the weekend come and I count the hours to go to my parents' house.,1
I haven't been looking for friends or anyone else.,1
When I was with you I complained that I didn't have time for family and friends.,-1
"Now I just don't complain about anything, I keep quiet and keep it all inside.",1
The urge to cry returns.,-1
My eyes start to fill with tears.,-1
Before I met you I had many friends.,1
"I left home early and came back very late, that's when I got back.",1
I went around the world enjoying everything I could with no time to end.,1
I had no fears.,1
"I had loves, conquests.",-1
I did it because I didn't know what love was.,1
"She goes out with her friends, goes out with the boys.",1
I've asked myself that question and come back three times and today the suffering is a thousand times greater.,1
This time I'll have to be strong.,1
"I'm not a person to tell dreams or real facts, but as it was an experience of such proportions that I'm giving up.",1
"I'm having a relationship with a person at work, yes we work in the same company but in different places, describing him is talking about a tall man, with a voice that makes you get all wet, yes it's a voice that needs no comments.",-1
"His body is a spectacle with the right to want more, his smile is as naughty as the owner himself.",1
"We had not been in contact for a few days, when he called me asking if I had forgotten him and why I had disappeared.",-1
"We went to meet, but we were thirsty for the other who felt his member in me, while we were ""devouring"" each other with kisses that made your mouth water just to see it.",1
He moaned the way he got so excited.,-1
"When he turned me over, he kissed me so hard that we started to come together.",-1
"My body was shaking, more than his, my legs were wobbly.",1
We take a shower together and when we start drying off he throws me on the bed and his mouth makes me moan.,1
"My head and heart had been so racing, I kept waiting for him so I could come.",1
This time he made me come so that my whole body shook.,1
After 6 hours of pleasure we left the motel.,1
But I was still in ecstasy.,1
"I met a friend of my sister's these days, he's 17 years old and from what I've noticed, he's pretty cool. read this.",1
Today will be the day he will be completely and madly in love with you if everything went right.,1
"From all the love in the world to him, without falling into temptation.",1
"Today I'm very upset, I think I'm being cheated on my husband is treating me differently with a lot of coldness.",-1
"He already cheated on me once and I forgave him, he is acting the same as before, treating me with the utmost coldness.",1
Talked to my ex.,-1
"People only know things by living, many judge.",-1
"Only those who really know, I'm the one who's living, feeling.",0
"He said he doesn't want me to be separated, he doesn't want to see me alone.",1
"He said he really likes me, and asked me to be patient.",1
"It's only for me to separate, when he separates.",-1
"All I want most is for things to work out with my husband, to experience intense love with him.",1
"Saying that I admire you, that I like you is too little.",-1
"For this friendship of ours deserves more than words, it deserved to be told to the world, so that everyone could feel, and maybe even understand, the meaning of our friendship.",1
"But lately I can't stand it, it's like I need something more, you know, or rather, I need, I need you.",-1
"What I'm feeling for you is something that even I can't explain, I tried to get involved with many, I tried to forget you in many ways, but I can't, you're stronger than me.",-1
"I didn't even get a kiss from you, but I can say that it wasn't necessary for me to fall madly in love with you.",1
"I wanted to forget the light in your eyes, so I wouldn't miss them, I wanted to forget the tone of your voice, your way of speaking, I wanted to forget that beautiful smile that only you have.",1
"I wanted so much, but I can't, because what I feel for you is so strong, impossible to forget.",-1
"But one thing is certain, I love you very much and even though I want to forget you, I love you more and more, today more than yesterday, tomorrow more than ever.",1
"Being without you is having the notion of time and not knowing how to fill it, is losing peace and knowing the absence of someone present.",-1
"Waiting is painful, forgetting is painful, but not knowing what to do is the worst kind of suffering.",-1
" I've waited so long to get to this point, I don't know what else to do, I'm afraid of losing your friendship, or rather, I believe I lost it, because you don't even want to accept me, you want more.",-1
But the fear of you distancing yourself from me is greater than anything.,-1
Pay attention to the music I listen to and the things I post.,1
"The way I treat you, the way I care about you.",1
"I really needed to tell you this, I couldn't take it anymore.",0
"When night comes, time to sleep, I rest my head on the pillow and my thoughts transport me to a wonderful world.",1
"I think I'm in your arms, huddled and shy, in love and fulfilled.",-1
I feel the strength and warmth of the man of my life.,1
I dream about you all night and I feel anxious and insecure not knowing if one day I will make this dream come true.,1
Don't be surprised by this confession.,-1
It really is a bold declaration of love.,1
I don't want this to disturb you and take away your peace.,-1
"On the contrary, I would like to always be by your side to love you and give you a lot of affection.",1
I want all the peace of mind for you.,1
"Think about it, know that I love you very much, I really want your company.",1
I want to give you all my love.,1
Cover you with kisses and satisfy all your desires.,1
"This is all I had the courage to dream, in the hope of one day seeing this claim of mine come true.",1
"Now you must know why I can't stand your girlfriends, because they were always with the boy I really love and the one I want to be with and always wanted.",1
"Maybe what you said doesn't matter at all, as you started a new relationship not long ago, but I needed to express myself anyway.",1
"And I hope you understand me, because I didn't ask to fall in love, because what commands us is the heart.",1
"Honestly, love is not chosen, it just happens.",1
"Things happen at the worst times, it's part of that long journey called life.",-1
"I woke up as usual at 6:20 am to go to school, got ready, and went.",1
"Arriving there I spoke with my friends and went to the hall where I wait for my boyfriend every day until 7:20, then he arrived, put his materials away and came to talk to me.",1
He walked up to me and gave me a really tight hug and said I love you.,1
"He asked if I was better (I've been crying lately), I told him I was fine, but I can't fool him, he knew I wasn't fine.",1
"As I walked into my room with my eyes full of tears I had to contain myself, because the girls who claim to be my friends would only want to know why I was crying and would criticize me.",-1
"I then spent 3 classes holding back from crying and trying to study, because I was going to have 3 tests after the break.",-1
"These 3 hours passed, the break came, I met my boyfriend again, we went downstairs together and we went to the patio to sit in the same place we used to sit every day.",-1
"I was dying to cry, so I held back the tears and told him I couldn't look at him that if I looked at him my eye would start to water.",-1
"It was complicated, because I couldn't concentrate on anything else, what I wanted most was to finish these exams and go home crying everything I held back.",-1
"Finishing the test, I went down to meet him in the courtyard, he took the book from my hand and we went to the stop, when we got there we sat down and started talking, conversation went, conversation came.",-1
"I confess that I was very upset about that, because I never stopped thinking about him in these 10 months of dating, I always gave him things on commemorative dates, when I got home, I cried a lot.",1
My boyfriend and I then had a falling out over the phone and I started crying.,-1
"I love him so much and I never want to lose him, because he is the reason for my smiles, my happiness!",1
"We always say that we are not going to fall in love with the wrong people, but without realizing it, we are already enchanted by the person without even knowing them well.",-1
"Indulging too much, believing and we always suffer from it.",-1
"We give our heart, pride and all our love.",1
"And how many times have we cried for the person who doesn't deserve a drop of our tears, we run after him and don't see the truth, and many times we don't want to see it, because the truth hurts and hurts a lot.",-1
"And when we find that special person who makes you smile, forgets your past and makes you think about the present, we don't stop thinking about them, we become obsessed with them, we learn to like that like and to do what she does just to say we have a lot in common,",1
"And when you wake up, you wake up with her in your head, thinking that I miss you, and dreaming big, putting that person in our life.",1
Many times this person hurt our feelings without even knowing what we feel.,-1
"The worst thing is when we get attached to that person and they leave, not knowing that the one they stayed with is still in love, that they can't imagine their life without them, and we say life goes on, but a part of us she takes it with people passing by.",1
"Our heart is always the victim, it is always in pieces.",-1
It fires when the person gets close and hits harder because it already thinks it's your other half.,1
"And when that person gets close to you, your hand trembles, your heart races, our world becomes different, because that person is too special.",-1
People would like to share with you my story with my family.,1
"My mother was a single mother, I had no father.",0
She had 5 children and none had a father.,1
"she was always considered by her relatives as nothing, she had no money, she was sick and very unhappy.",-1
When I was three years old I went to live with an aunt because my mother couldn't afford to raise me.,-1
"This aunt, despite giving me everything, was a demon, she would yell at me, let other relatives mistreat and beat me, sometimes she would beat me, leave me grounded in places where I was scared to death, in short, she was and is a fake, disgusting, bad witch.",1
"When I returned to my mother's house at the age of 13, my older sister was in a life of drugs and wrong things, she always beat me, used my clothes and left them dirty, lent them to her drug addict friends, teased me in such a way that I wanted to get out of that hellhole.",1
"When I thought I would have peace, my older brothers were very aggressive, they hit me for anything, they didn't hit me, they beat me, once my brother kicked me in the belly, I had my period for almost ten days.",-1
"I remember I ate a lot at school, so I didn't have to eat at home, and I took a shower in secret, it was very sad.",1
At the age of 15 I practically ran away from home and until today at the age of 20 I haven't come back.,1
"I got help from someone to rent a house, buy furniture, go to college and have a life more or less.",1
