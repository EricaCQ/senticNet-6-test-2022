"Hi dear diary, one more time i am here feeling a shit and the fault is all mine."
It is wonderful know that each day we are uniting each time more.
In life we need count on the support of that person that we choose to share of all of our moments.
I am really happy and i hope that you too.
"To celebrate we order pizza, and I made a letter and left from his side of bed!"
We own the basic ingredient that will all support and that so few have the priviledge to have: the Love.
"A toast of our existence, and to our future."
Today a war ends.
"Do not ends one battle, the war will continue, the war is destroy the chains that separate me from my aspirations, that sepate me from my dreams."
"I am too tall and thin, have no body, and suffer because of that."
"And the following is, I already have 13 years and I BARELY do not have a body, the girls of my class are already formed, and me here with my thin thighs."
"Imagine a girl 14 years old tall, and without breast, butt, long thin thighs, of course would be a shit."
"I am already little lady, already notice that boys look on girls with big breast and butt, almost no one notice on me, and this is very annoying."
"When everything seems to fall apart inside of me, I feel myself in pieces."
"All I want is to stay alone, turn off the bedroom light and wait the time pass, waiting that the pain go away."
The time always help but sometimes 1 minute alone inside this dark room seems so much longer.
"I feel weak to fight for everything I want, and the people are always disappointing us."
Trust in yourself is the best solution to not find yourself in these situations.
"Try be strong and belive, that everything will pass."
"I love the way you observe me with so much tenderness, like if everything on me was uprededented."
I love your sincerity and innocence.
You make me feel good and I feel that am truly loved.
"I just can't take more listen effrontery, joke, throwing in my face things that he did for me, and therefore I decided be call girl."
"Wrote this report, at orders by my son's father."
"He insisted that I report exactly our romance, from the beginning, without omitting nothing, and then publish on internet."
"I am  married, happily married, have a good good where I have met a person."
"You know that person that you indentify yourself right in face, lunch every day and ends up getting friends."
"Since we lunch almost every day together, we end up knowing each other well, knew about his girlfriends and he a little more of me."
"Started taking rides with him at the end of  expedient, fact that I thought it better hide from my husband, he thinks that I come back by bus, but bus are are so full and longs."
"One day, the traffic was horrible stopped by floods, and he suggested stop in a little street to give a break, luckly the car has dark glass giving more safety."
"He talked turned to me with the hand on back of my seat and, strangely I started feeling well stay there with him."
"Started to feel  a strange, internal excitement, not exactly for him, but for the situation."
"After all, to me, that always took the life of loyal wife, everything was novelty, and novelty always attract the women."
"He put his hand until mine neck, I felt his breath."
"I got scary, he noticed and came getting closer each more, hold my face; was getting his face closer until that he touched his lips on mine."
I didn't know what to do!
I became surprised and paralized!
I felt a schock and a warm by my whole body due this unsual situation.
"I, already with a accelerated breath."
"We ended up kissing each other more and more, my arms hugged him."
"I confess that it gave me a pleasure almost unknown, it was a delight to feel our tongues leaning while he squeezed my breasts."
"He implied that I could be pregnant, I said that, no way, because I was taking contaceptive."
"I wish so much that the things had been differents, but sadly the lord changed the way of our lifes forever."
"Didn't take nothing to my future, you forgot me like if I have never existed."
"But all right, now I realized that I never needed you for nothing because even when I missed you and I cried."
"I started to not miss you, to no cry anymore because the love of my mother filled me up and drowned all my pain."
We never should forget that we are the architects of our own destiny each one has his own free will to follow your life the way you want.
"I hope that you are being very happy, have a peaceful old age, be healthy to take care of your children, they need you."
I can't hold this with me anymore.
It is really sad know that I have a sister that made me date a gay boy simply to muffle his romance with my 15-years old nephew.
"It is more sad still know that she was pressing me to lose my virginity with him, supported my relationship, let get me involved until I fell strongly in love for him."
"I'm tired of argue with my mom, of her never being on my side."
"The worst of all, was that he broke up with me, claiming that I could not stay until 4 in the morning on street."
"Tonight the moon looks so beautiful, so perfect, a God masterpiece."
"I always liked to admire the sky, to see the stars, to understand the mystery of what has up there and when i see the moon, ah moon!"
"She records me so many beautiful stuffs, it is like if she was accomplice of lovers, of those in love and sometime I stay to watch her and feel a very good peace."
Thank you God for do all this for me.
Love you so much my Dad!
"My boyfriend doesn't have any style, help me?"
"Guys I always walk very tidy, smelling, made-up next to my boyfriend, I never made him be ashamed nowhere"
People even look and doesn't belive that were dating.
"Today I was coming to work hoping to drop all flowery in high heels, a lace vest, made-up in agreement to my clothing with a earring fallen from rayban."
"And my boyfriend was wearing jeans shorts, a polo, and a okley tennis shoes that his left foot was without laces, all ripped, dirty."
"It is disgusting, then I took the company bus and when I went up he took a arm from the shirt and later would take the rest of the shirt."
"What a shame that I was in the bus, he was all crazy."
I bought a red V-neck shirt with zipper for him.
Today is my birthday.
I alreay started the day badly.
"Mu mother didn't remember, a few people remembered."
"And my father, of course won't remember."
"I don't know, each day that passes I wish less to be here."
"Last year was everything too much ""perfect"" and this year, not a bit."
"Who I most expected that would remember, din't remember."
I just want this day ends soon.
"Yesterday I came normal from school, had lunch and I was with the headphone on the last volume."
"My 4 years old cousin was on the room talking with my motther, then I simply finish and went to the room."
"It is that hard for her to love me, because she said that I won't make a difference, the only thing I wanted was to be friend of my mother but she prevents me to do it."
"I think that I will not pass to ITB, much less to FIEB."
"In the ITB, I think I got 35, of 50"
"I have never regretted so much, I doubt that I will pass with these scores, to pass em Edifications it has to hit at least 40."
Of course I will not be one of the 24 people who got most right!
I will die by shame when the score be released!
"Everybody keeps saying that I already passed, but they don't have in mind that I chose the most competed course!"
"I'm really bad, I should have listened my math teacher and chosen a random course."
"In the FIEB, I have even less chances."
Everydoby keep saying that I passed but I know I didn't.
"Wednesday night the results will be out, then I will know how many I got right."
"And on the 22nd day, the list of summoned will be out, on 28nd the second list, and them, if have, has even the list of remaining vacancies."
But I think that not even in the ramaining I gonna be.
"It was so many people, I'm sure that the 24 who make it will have gauge the test!"
But is not for that you feel the necessity of live annoucing your qualities.
"Prefer the description, stay quiet, observing and taking your own conclusions."
Worry too little with the outside opinion.
Have a big sensuality and know very well how to explore it.
"Tends to be jealous and pocessive, what is a big defect."
Would be good take care with certain manias.
I thought a lot today in everything you have said to me.
My insomnia have reached a critical level and I finally decided going to a psychiatrist to see what he could do.
I entered there decided that I would only left with some other remedy besides the antidepressant.
"He prescribed me zolíde, a hypnotic, to help me sleep."
"Although being red stripe, I won't be able to use more than two months, because of dependency."
"I spent a good time reflecting if I would take or not, like if that was some poison or something alike."
"Me and my fear of taking new medicines, affraid of giving me some colateral reaction or something like that."
"But it was easy. I laid down and slept like a baby, both time that I took."
"And when I awake, I don't expend the day like harmed."
I awake much more willing.
I love the medicine until now.
Last week I had sex with my boyfriend at his house.
"He, like I predicted, didn't have a condom, and I refused to have sex that way."
Then he said that we would do it another day.
I insisted and went to buy the condom at the pharmacy by myself.
"I got a little embarrassed, but it was worth it."
"Once in a while we have our fights, but I love him."
"I don't know, it is a weird relationship."
I change my feelings a lot in relation to him.
"Sometimes looks that I don't feel nothing for him, when we fight."
But there is a time that looks that I'm gonna explode of some much love.
"And he notices that, like I get cold with the minor fight."
"About the TOC symptoms, they still be annoying."
The thought 'I want kill myself' shows up very frequently.
"And I already walked getting a little hurt again, despite  I have never stopped, stricly."
I scream dozen of times during the day.
"The compulsion for candies continues, gives ne a momentary relief."
"Even smelling glue is something I thought to do, in fact was more a symbolic thing from my despair, I knew that wouldn't bring forward in nothing."
"And was really one of those styrofoam glues, and it was already dry."
"But spite of all those things, sometimes I forget of everything I'm going through and I feel so well."
"The antidepressant has its contribution parcel, but it is not only his."
"I don't think my life is a disgrace, despite the TOC, low self esteem, anxiety, insomnia, panic, family problems."
"And talking about that, next monday my college classes starts."
"The subjects are a little annoying, but at least the hourly load is lower."
"Most of the classes are in the morning, that is, I have to wake up early."
"On one hand it will be good because I won't have to hear my mother shouting on traffic, what already helps a lot."
"Today about to turn 30, I solved put an end to my fats and lift my self esteem."
"I have the height of 1,57 m and 60 kg."
I'm already on the limit to get overweight.
"Hi Dear Diary, I was missing you, I was not writing so much because my vacation was being so tedious and I haven't so much ehat to write, but now the classes returned and I going back to write!"
"Well, my first school day already started with two new teachers."
"In the first schedule Ricardo, with math and geometry, on the second one Kairton with grammar, interpretation and writing."
"In the Ricardo's class we also revised some subjects from last year and gave a homework, I liked him, he is funny!"
"In the Kairton's class we also revised, but the part that I most liked was when went to evaluate the music."
"We went to evaluate the music that was that music from Legião Urbana, Pais e Filhos, gee I love that music."
I heard everything and became very pround of myself!
"And yeah, he already memorized my name, that annoying Aline got dying of envy I am liking the new teachers, specially Kairton."
"No, now you are great!"
"Well, I saw him, he saw me, but didn't talk to me."
"I won't talk about the Santa Maria tragedy, as just think about give me urge to cry, well I will finish now, after school I going to tell more!"
"Looks loke I always follow the most complicated way, I'm tired of everything be so dramatic."
"My world, my dramas."
"Seeing you leaving could be one more, but this is not what is happening."
"I think in you the entire time, and my heart hurts as I imagine what are you doing."
All the moments that I am losing with you.
I feel myself weak and suffocated by my own heart.
"I think that he prefers you, and not my reason."
"Without you I feel myself without wings, incapable to fly."
A friend of mine had already conscience that I liked my friend.
"Today, on holiday eve, she was, by coincidence, on the same group of him, and decided ask if he liked me, but he said that just as friend."
"But then she started to talk that I liked him and in the end, praised the green eyes."
"This boys isn't convinced, is super nice, but for some time now I fell in love for him."
"He will probably talk to me, by facebook."
Will he start to analyse me?
"I particularly won't care if he talks that only wants me as a friend, it's ok, but I just don't want that he treats me worst."
Even more that everything that is happening lately is taking me close to him.
Guys I'm 13 years olds and i'd never kissed on my entire LIFE.
And the worst of all is that I was never of talk a lot with the boys and also don't consider myself a very pretty person.
"I was a very shy kid, I remember that the hole class was making mess and I stood there in the corner, alone whiout talking to anyone."
It was always very hard to befriend with people.
The miserable life of Paulo Anderson.
"How much sadness and deceptions I have already been through in this life isn't it, fortunately I only write for myself, because only myself know all that I have been through, never wanted to share my shit life with anyone."
My life is a suffering internal and external.
"I've never been starving neither had illness, I thank God for have my two eyes."
I took refuge inside of umbanda with my guides and guides of others.
"Were so many difficulties, so many mysteries, so many questions without explanation."
I've already lost count of how many ways I have already tried find out the truth.
"Wrong yards, wrong guides, lack of education with people, responsability, lack of attitude, lack of lucky, lack of going out, lack of running for, excessive wank, letters, tarot, opening works."
"In how many reasons I have already thought to be the reason of my suffering, and even today I had not found the answer!"
"Today with 21 years, as if by help from the auto, started to see this week reports from people that were cured through past lifes teraphy."
"Symptoms that I have always suffered like shyness, depression, isolation, misguided mediumship, family fights, emotional need and professional life, I tried look some way of some auto regression but I didn't find it."
"So I decided look in Google some clinic that provided past life therapy in Goiânia, until then I didn't know that this existed here, only saw by television."
"I found Crisanne Braga's blog, a great holistic therapy from town, read some articles on her blog and entered in contact wanting to know the prices."
"Today was my first session, the therapist cause me a good impression."
"We chatted and then I familiarized with her, I thought I wouldn't have the corauge of teeling my problems to a unknown, but I was able to talk about everything to her."
"During a moment of deconcentration and laughs, I had a really strange moment, I felt a spirit close to me and suddenly I had a sensation that I had already been on that clinic before."
"Everytime my brother-in-law comes home, hegives a way to be alone with me."
"Since it is raining today I lay down, because he came sneaky and sat by my side, until then okay."
"But he started deflecting the look from TV to me, I pretended that I didn't see and remained focused on TV."
Then he started to put his hand under the cover to try touch me.
"Of course I didn't let... Damn it, does my sister not see that he stinks."
"Then I stood up and went outside, because didn't took so much and he went after, asking me until what time I worked."
I said that I worked until late.
And it is not the first time that he tries something... I don't want to enter in details.
I will be cheering to him to stay far away from me... Not least he is not handsome at all.
"Well, before everything I should express here that she was the one that sent the e-mail down here, telling detail by deatil of everything and promise that is 100% true."
"Arriving at the factory I made the normal process, when I'm arriving to my room I see my phone ring and when I see his name shows up on the display, my heart accelerate, I answer and we schedule an appointment to see on the exit, I get a little tranquil."
"At lunchtime, he calls me and say that he is with a bigger boner, god my body gets hot, like something fires in me at his voice sound."
I confirmed and waited the hour.
"The internal bus stopped ans asked if I would go to Benq, I informed that I would not."
"They left, I entered on the room, he was in front of the computer, when I put the purse and a bag that was on a table next to him, he kissed me like he wanted more, we started the preliminaries there."
"We left the factory, and went to a place next with a few stars, but viable, arriving in the room, a not so good stand, but as we were already with desire of the other we started, but I asked to clean myself, because I handle pieces with oil, graxe etc."
"I feel myself very dirty, so I entered and wet my body, passed my hand on the soap that was on my table, because I had bought to meet his mother."
"I'm here to share my sad life, specifically my sad life as a cocaine addicted."
"It is already more than 5 years that I suffer from this affliction, I lost a lot and I've been losing a lot more each day, today was one of those days that I thought on suicide, but again I decided to continue trying."
"Sou sozinho apesar de ser casado, mas há tempo que este casamento não passa de um papel assinado, o amor se foi juntamente com o respeito e a confiança, tudo o que sobrou foi o comodismo, a tristeza e a falta de esperança por falta da minha esposa."
"Já fiz e sofri coisas que me fazem sentir um lixo, passei por situações que não se pode desejar nem ao seu pior inimigo, hoje não vou dar detalhes, mas com o decorrer do tempo falarei sobre isso."
"I'm alone, my wife spent the day outside and said to be at her mother's house, I say that she said because I affraid be cheated for some time."
"I've already hurt my wife in so many forms, that I don't even have the courage to call her, even thinking that she could be on a motel with someone."
"I don't have courage to charge loyalty and that for a man is the biggest of the shames, I'm not a man, I'm not a person, I'm nothing with the drugs."
"I'm here, feeling the drug taste that still drain down the throat, doening from my nose, I'm depressed, near to desperation and with a huge sadness."
"I know that the excessive sadness is due to the drug effects, I know that the chemical sadness will pass, but the real sadness by the life I live, that is behind every day."
"I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do,  I'm lost, I asked help even to my dog in a psychotic hope that he would answer, or do something magical."
"I just don't have anyone to appeal, I don't have mom neither family due my disagreements that I had with my mom that was always violent or sick."
Always lost the control and used the demoniac evilness in the beatings that gave me.
"My father, never was a real paternal figure, obfuscated by my mom's strength."
"My sister, I have nothing with her, doesn't exist for me, my brother, I feel sorry, but he lives well after all."
"It's midnight now, I'm going to watch some miniseries, delude myself with the hope of happy endings that always exist there, and wait thar someday I have a happy ending just mine."
"Now it's already 00:03, I'm depressed, alone and unsure about my future."
"But I keep fighting, I fight since the day I gave up of killing myself jumping from the slab over a bamboo at two and more a.m. of a starry night."
"Well, this is my first text, so I will present myself, my name is Kevin, I live in PE."
"Since last night, my mother doesn't even look at my face neither talks to me."
Today I wake up and she didn't even see me.
"She has the mania to talk the things to me and then say on my face, that she didn't say nothing of that."
"Like this, last week I did her hair, because I do hairdressing course, so I have to train, but of course one brush and flat iron, I know what to do perfectly."
"So I did her hair, brush it out, to match the cut, then she came saying that it was horrible and ordered to remake all again, but to inside."
"When she went last week, she asked to do her hair again, then I did, to outside and such."
"Then she came saying that was horrible, that I didn't know how to do anything right, that my course has no value and that the other prople do better than me."
"Wow that hurted me, imagine, would hurt anyone, wouldn't it?"
"Then I told to my father, we were in the room me, my mom and my father, then my mother said that I never do anything for her, never was with good will to give opinions about her hair and such."
"I told to my father, what she said to me that day, she said that was a lie, that I'm a lier and she didn't say none of that."
"Dude, really, that leave me furious with her."
Why does she lie like that?
"And it wasn't the first time, she always lies."
"She tells me things and then says that she didn't say, calls me liar."
I like her a lot and I know that she loves me.
"My grandmother passed away, I can't handle this situation."
"I am affraid of falling into depression again, my heart is on a big empty, I try doing everything to occupy my head, spend my time and nothing consoles me, nothing takes the image of her last sigh of my head."
"I love you granny, continue to take care of me from where you are, thanks for the wonderful grandmother who were with me, for each caring gesture ans smile."
"You were, is, and always will be my warrior, you have not lost for cancer, but the cancer lost to you my warrior."
"You weres till playing, making us smile and everytime someone said, how are you Ms. Maria?"
"You always answered, well thank God, such a warrior woman you were granny, I love you so much."
"Such a pain is this longing, everyday when I wake up I grab the phone wanting to call to know how you are, I think I still can't discern all this."
"I love you and each of your gesture will be here in my heart to remember your love for us, I love you."
"I will miss you, is a piece of me that will be missed a lot."
Why do I feel so bad and negative?
"I went to a doctor and he said that all these pains that I'm feeling are caused by nervousness, and how I will be calm?"
"Not everything worked so well like it is now, but I STILL belive this year will be good."
"Dude, I cry sometimes without notice and bite my mouth to not get something off one’s chest in front of someone."
"Hear trash from my dad and see my mom proposing ridiculous things make me worst, more nervous."
"More useless pain, no pain that helps me grow or mature me."
I just want my life back and I just want all of this to end.
My immunity doesn't support anymore.
"Today I went to the gym right, as promised."
"It was full today and that sucks, it takes longer."
"I met a new girl there, I think we will be friends."
"But something funny happened, in fact since the first day."
"It's my instructor, he keeps drooling directly my egg dude, from my arrival until I leave."
"On the other two times it was also like that, but now it's too munch."
"And I'm a person that don't notice when someone has interest for me, but on this case I am suspicious about that."
"Today I arrived there was about 7 o'clock, he came smiley said the thing I should do, and from appliance to appliance he came and was telling me something."
"In my last appliance he stood by me and I said that I was tires, then he said: ""If you want you can stay there, until 10 o'clock, that we close the gym."""
"At the time I left he gave me a bonbon, serenata de amor."
"The worst is that he is the only one there in the time I go, and I get dull with that right?"
"But, I din't give a back off to him, even because he didn't ask me nothing, just treat me that way, bagging."
"I'm going to dinner, stay with the most handsome boy in the world."
"Well, today me and my friends had the idea of making the Pen Game."
Maybe the way me and my friends did it is wrong but looks real.
"Well, my name is Daniele Felix, I'm 15 years old and don't have anyone to get something off one’s chest so I choose here."
I am upset with everything that is happening to me.
"Some months ago I met a friend again, so he started to give me ideia and belived, he said so many beautiful things."
"I got very sad because I liked him so much and was willing to do everything for him, then the tears dropped out of control, so I told everything to my friend, she was helping me a lot."
But he left me as second option.
"I went to a barbecue in a friend's house, and I met her, Carol was her name, after I found out that was Jessica but okay."
"I was with her and at that we went to a motel, that day I played with her saying that she would fall in love with me."
"I confess that I really liked stay with her, it was really good, but get lost I thought she wouldn't want to see me another times."
"After sometime, we ended up seeing each other and be together more times."
"But there is something about her that bothered me a lot, her mode to see the life, she was vulgar, thought only in parties, go out to drink, have fun, as if this was in first place on her goals."
"But now before break up, I'm feeling weird, I think I ended up liking her, of the way she treats me, wanting me to always be with her, her way to feel jealous, and always wanting be next to her, always say that miss her, not caring to spend her breaks with me locked in a room talking, to be honest, I will miss her."
"At this moment, I'm avoiding her, and it's giving me a squeeze, in my heart, but I have to do this, it can't continue, and I am very jealous and intolerant with these kinds of things, there is no minimun chance to me and her work."
"I will miss her, but that's life, sometimes we have to give up of something, so we can continue out routes."
"Recently I've been very compulsive - for masturbation with the vibrator, for food, shaking me, biting me, souring me."
"Wasn't really a sex, but it was nice."
"And we had sex two more times in a motel - didn't reach the orgasm, in fact my vibrator gives me more pleasure, but anyway, everything that gives me pleasure I accept."
"In the last psychiatric consultation, he wanted to give me a neuroleptic (refused immediately, get fat I'm out) and on the return he suggested a mood stabilizer."
"He kinda suggested that I have borderline personality ans bipolar spectrum (cyclothymia) at last, nothing that I didn't already suspect."
I didn't accept the stabilizer for the same reason as risperidone.
"I'm a fat whale, I don't want to get more fat and done."
Then he thought I was better and put on the recipe only one fluoxetine pill.
It's true that being with these hypomanic crises is kinda embarrassing - but be depressed and with suicidal ideas is also not cool.
I'm really stressed lately.
I argued with my mom because of the notebook that she didn't wanted to borrow me to do the work and burned myself with the candle.
I got a new notebook.
"I had a cry crisis while having sex with my boyfriend, accusing him of not loving me, treating me like a object and I asked him to don't touch me anymore."
He wanted to do anal sex in me and was insisting a lot.
"Ok, my reaction was super exagerated, didn't need be like that."
"Then he said that I value and devalue him too quickly, that I change the mood constantly, one time I'm sad and another super happy and asked me if I had some personality or mood disorder."
I'm writing disconected words because my mind is disconected.
My thought is confused and disorganized.
"Yes, that's ashames me, I like being under control."
I'm in charge at sex time.
"I stay on top of him, ride on him, say that I paid that fucking motel for one hour and half and I want to have sex until one hour and half."
Finally on vacation.
"Well, my psychiatrist wanted that I tried to be with only a fluoxetine pill."
It didn't even last 2 weeks and I couldn't stand it and asked him to go back to the previous dosage - 2 pills.
"I was all the time 'I want to kill myself, kill myself' I wasn't sleeping, screaming anguish and anxiety, crying over any little thing."
Lately my instincts for sex and aggression have been very much in evidence.
 And I think I'm getting addicted to watching porn on the internet.
"Well, I can't take this anxiety anymore."
And I was particularly attracted to scenes of sadomasochism
"At the same time they do me good, but at the same time they do me bad."
I start to remember my assaults and humiliations and I get sick.
"I don't know, it's such a weird thing."
"And I keep feeling like I'm some kind of slut too, like they are - who am I to call someone a slut anyway?"
"And the moans are so forced, it sounds more like they are having sex than sex - not sex, more like copulation."
"But anyway, sex is sex, and that relaxes me."
"I don't want to become a whale, I'm already too fat!"
At least porn is doesn't makes you fat.
"I can't stand to be away from my boyfriend anymore - I want to have sex, damn it!"
 He traveled and I'm here on a boredom.
Now he's got this thing about controlling me.
I had another mood swing phase in front of him and he threatened to break up with me if I didn't take the mood stabilizers.
"Well, I have been doing some research and the coolest little thing I found is lamotrigine, which don't make me fat."
"Topiramate is slimming, but it fucks with your memory, and for a college student this is not cool."
"Well, I don't know if I will take it yet."
I am afraid of turning into a robot.
Today my class went to the library after the break.
"During the break time I was looking at the books to see which one I would choose, but I didn't find any interesting ones."
"I had one there ""Biloca's Diary"" is a short little book."
It doesn't have that many pages and the writer wasn't known to me either!
"I picked it up thinking it was one of those children's books that says: ""Dear Diary.. Today I learned to read.. """
Biluca is not a very well-known name.
"So, I didn't even have time to read a page of the book and it already hit."
I went to class and a little later my teacher took us to the library.
I rented the book and left.
When the librarian went to deliver the book she almost died of shame for having picked up that book.
But I ended up reading it and got really interested in it.
I have already read half of the book and I can see that it is totally different from what I thought.
"Talk about an almost teenager (almost, because she is still forming and stuff), my God."
"The discovery of new feelings, new actions, and so on."
"When I read the rest of the book, I won't even miss the chance to summarize it."
"Mother, I'm sorry for who I am, for me being so and only me, for me being ""different"", for me being so wrong in your eyes."
"I'm sorry, or rather, forgive me for not being the daughter of your perfect dreams, for only letting you down when you expected the most from me."
But it's just that it's so hard for me to please you.
"In opposite, I love you very much!"
"I love you more than myself, after all you are my mother."
"Hate, I don't have for you, nor for my father even though he is absent."
"Hate, I have to myself for not being the daughter you always wanted and wished for; and no matter how hard I try - yes, I try."
Forgive me for not having grown up in the way and manner you expected.
Only you don't know how much it hurts when you disapprove of everything I do to you.
You don't know how much it hurts me when you belittle and humiliate me in front of anyone.
"I just wanted you to be proud, but it turns out I'll never really be good enough for you, and I can't pretend it's okay anymore, because it's not!"
"I'm sorry, but I will never be perfect and that, believe me, hurts me more than it hurts you."
"I can't stand our fights anymore, they leave me in a state that I can't even explain in words."
"And nothing will change the things you told me, nothing will make 'us' work again."
"But Mom, please don't give up on me like this."
"I can't believe how difficult it is to talk to you, to my own mother."
Yesterday [Sunday] I couldn't write here because I was too 'busy'.
"I went out on Saturday for my cousin's bride shower, who is soon to be married."
"It was me, my sister, boyfriend, father and mother."
My boyfriend slept in my house.
"I share the room with my sister, so was me in my bed, he on the mattress (on the floor next to me) and my sister in her bed next to me."
"We arrived from the party and immediately went to ""sleep"", my sister was the first to fall asleep, while my boyfriend and I held hands (he lay down and so did I... and talked softly)."
Then suddenly my sister gets up and starts crying like crazy.
"In the end, she ended up sleeping with my father, and my mother in her (my sister's) bed."
"My mom is very nice, she has a way of a teenager and a woman's head.. she is always in a good mood, when we go to parties she dances, shakes, makes everyone happy."
"Her relationship with my boyfriend is great, they both joke around and I love it."
"Then he hugged me, kissed me, and we stayed up talking for a while and then we went to sleep."
"I am very chilly, when I was in my bed, I took 3 blankets and was in a cold sweater."
It was only when he hugged me that I also started to feel warm and took off my cold sweater.
"When I woke up, my boyfriend had his hand on my waist, hugging me, and his head close to my hair."
"He says that he got up before me, and kept kissing my face, and I didn't even move of so much sleep."
We got up and went buy beer to my mom.
"After some time, we lay on the sofa (it was already late) because he wanted he watch that game that would be on TV."
"When I woke up he hugged me, kissed me calling me lazy and said ""love you"", he is so gorgeous."
"We stayed the rest of day necking, we arranged to go to the mall to him paid a bill, but who said that the lazy let?"
"So that's it, I stop here, today I'm very happy and missing him already, we are stick by our way, and I love that."
It's very good have a person that you love by your side.
"Besides wake up with a 'I love you', makes the day wonderful and happy."
"At last, good night, and I would like to thank to the comments from previous subject."
"Well, it all started in April last year when my mother started dating a man that I don't know where it appeared, well they were dating for a week and he was already living into my house."
"On his birthday, I saw him hiding drugs into my room, and I went there and told my mom."
They fight and she broke up with him.
"But then at 5 a.m., I wake up with my mom screaming and asking for help, he had entered into the house and was trying to kill her."
"It wasn't enough the fact of having a thief at home, he would not let my mom talk to me anymore, he wouldn't let her go."
"And in that song, he starts to say some things about love, and I think it is simply beautiful everything he says!"
"A sense of failure took over me, sadness, discouragement and a total lack of enthusiasm for life."
"I feel my life so messy, see my eyes dying, my life taking the opposite direction than what I imagined one day."
Why did I never be able feel complete?
My heart today finds itself torn.
"Arrived at work so discouraged, see do many stuff to do but I don't have stimulus, it angers me when I think that I try to do my best and people indirectly disturb my work."
"At house, things are going from bad to worst, my brother and sister-in-law's situation spreads, causing a enormous suffering to my family."
I keep thinking what they are waiting to split up and end this suffering for all
"It's weird the way how I still think about him, I have desire to call him."
"I was very childish, the worst is that I still am, I'm not a little girl anymore, damn I'm a woman, there are things that I can't avoid."
"I see a lot of girls suffering for boys that don't give a minimum for them, so to get attention, they pretend to be something they are not."
"I think that's ridiculous, understand if he doesn't like you now, there is no point my child, in fact it matters, if you have a big butt and a big breast, he may even think of taking a interested in you."
"But doesn't matter you wanting to put a cleavage, and a short stucked on ass, girls like this are only seen as sexual object."
"Well, I made a research with some boys and they said that girls who say slangs it's normal, but talk a buch is weird."
"The case is that it is not behind him, I know it's hard not demonstrate what feels, but you can be sure, they don't give so much value to girls that stand behind them, pissing off all the time."
"If he broach a subject it's means he likes talking to you, but if you broach a subject, and he responds you with short phrases ou takes to long to answer and comes with excuses for the delay, it means that you are annoying him and he only answers you for politeness."
"Before sending, first see how was the direction between the two on the day."
"When you see him give some looks at him, (but without disguising) in the beggining he won't notice, but face him for 1 second, and then gently fiddling with the hair looking to another place."
"So, he will try to find out what you want."
"A lot of girls want get the boys attention, laughing high ou speaking louder, that is a girls without attitude thing, and you don't want to be seen linke this, right?"
"Post phrases of of detached girl, that don't need no man to be happy."
"When the phone rings, my heart just accelerates."
Loving you when the Sun rises in the moring.
"But you know, it's weird to think this is natural, I feel myself completely bad for him showing interest in others, I consider lack of respect."
"Look slyly to a beautiful woman is natural, which woman doesn't know that a handsome man passed by her too?"
"But the question is, show interest in another person, transpire that is noticing, staring?"
"Say that life is made by choices, is extremely easy."
Make the right choices is the difficulty of the thing.
"At age 27, I imagine myself still studying something that interest me, if it's needed to study all again, I imagine myself with a respect straw at hand, imagine myself have gone through the best and funniest things of life."
I imagine myself visiting my family at the weekends and listening to the nonsense that my father speaks and will always speak.
"I imagine myself thinking of children, after all I have a dream: adopting."
I imagine passing near my parents' house and leaving a warm bread in the afternoon.
"I imagine in peace with myself, with everything that I have made in my life."
"I've never dreesed up so fast, fortunately I live about five minutes by car to my work."
Today my friend (Luciano) embarrassed me.
"Next to our school, has a health center and I asked him to go there and take a condom for me, because even I'm a girl, I think it's good to have saved in case of having sex with someone with no condom and stay protected. "
I had to go to the lottery shops pay some bills (like always I leave everything late) and the line looked more like a snail to me.
"After one hour I made it, got my bus and a horrible traffic."
"On my birthday, worked all day, almost 20:00 and I'm here in this horrible traffic, I will get home just to sleep and today is my day, didn't enjoy nothing."
"It was perfect, my sister and my husband made everything, 2 types of pies, all beautiful."
Thank god by my husband's life.
"That way, you kissing me tasty and making everything that is entitled in four walls."
"Today, me and my boyfriend we had so much fun."
"We were on bus stop, playing like in the movies, he was running behind me, grabbed me by the waist, picked me up, lifted me up taking my feets ou of ground."
It was so good for moment forget all my problems.
"Went Saturday at the salon to make progressive, finally a good hair and not bad hair, wasn't taking that straw."
"Always at night I have fear, dread and I never sleep in the dark here has a small light that stay on, on my wedding night I want to do it in the clarity."
Today I went to sleep at 9am because I had gone to sleep at my boyfriend's house whiout my parents know.
I had to come back home early like I had gone to a ballad but turned out that nothing happened.
I had to come back home early like I had gone to a ballad but turned out that nothing happened.
I took advantage that I had already woken up and called to my boyfriend because we were going to see each other again.
I ended up meeting a person that I love and loves me too.
"I'm really thinking in run away from home and take a break, and in sequence live with my beloved!"
I thought I would never love nobody in my life and that happens after getting old.
"God, I'm really excited, I imagine me and my beloved together."
"My husband in 10 years can't put nothing in the house, the bills are late, the fridge empty, he is lazy!"
"Recorded a movie on TV, and now I felt like going to see it."
"The story talks about the fat friends, tha one day, get tired of being the way they are, get tired of seeing the funny face, get tired of not be able to do what other women do, get tired of being ""cuddly""."
"So, they decided make a pact, the cinderela pact, where they promise to each other that they will do everything to lose weight."
"And they do, lose weight and become women with a perfectly normal weight, and a lot more beautiful!"
"But this, as of today I will do my best, and will manage to do a healthy diet to lose weight."
"And I'm gonna show to all that, like all others girls, I alson can have a atletic body and be very skinny and perfect."
"Because I will be able to lose weight, and I will show to all that I'm not a random fat girl."
"We went out, and that's the third time I'm going to report it."
We had already arranged by cellphone on Sunday.
Monday would had a really good sex at bed.
"Well, we work at the same company, but in different areas, she is blond, long hair, a delight."
We arranged and there she was waiting for me at the parking lot.
"We left and went from ""work time"" to a motel called Beira Rio, next to our workplace."
"When we got there we went to a suite stand, super comfortable and there it began, kisses all over my neck and soon I saw that she was super fiery."
"I took off my pants and was left with only gray boxer shorts and a black tank top, she went to the bathroom and when she came back she had on killer red thong panties."
She sat on top of me and rubbed herself against me tasty.
"However, being alone is absolute the opposite of being with someone."
Being alone is like close the hands in nothing when you cross the street running and there is no hand to hold.
"Being alone is sad, piss off others and can be bad for your health."
I found out wuth my mom that my stepfather was cheating on her.
I also found out that he was cheating my mom with my aunt.
"And moreover, he hit my mother."
"He threatened me, said that would kill me."
"I still can't stop cutting myself, I know this is a problem and more, but damn it's hard."
"Sometimes comes to my head that nobody likes me, my mother is a bore, the only one that saves and that I still didn't do anything foolish because he doesn't let it's Vinny."
"Sometimes I feel myself sad, I'm 12 years-old and virgin mouth, most of my friend, are not virgin mouth of tongue, and the worst is I think I am ugly."
I've never loved anyone like I have loved you.
We are living in a world where the physical appearance has more value than internal appearance.
"Before doing history test, we prayed that prayer and I pray until today, it's already 3 years that I don't see the teacher that taught this prayer but I like her very much."
"Real frienships, that's what the world needs."
"Today was a day of so many surprises and joys, don't know how to say that I still don't belive that I'm awake thinking abou him at 5 a.m."
"He said he loved me, that miss me and when he finished college, would would come to get me."
"I came here after the light returned, I kept looking at the picture of him that I have."
"And I don't know what I'm feeling now but I feel calm and happy, but I don't know..."
He completes me when you miss something in you but you never knew what was and then find someone that understands you and all half opposite you and then you feel complete.
"Look, I'm not very tall, but enough for my age and I'm under the ideal weight."
"Always when you do those screenings at school, I'm always alerted because I'm under and I don't like this!"
"When I try to warm the people close to me, they say that ""You are thin, has to gain wheight and so"", but when I try to play with the situation to warm, they say ""Oh, but you are not very tall""."
"After all, the boys also like girls that have some body. Not only the ones that look like they have only bones."
"I don't have brothers and for a lot reasons, learn that my best friends can't keep a secret."
"I look very cheerful, because I learned that cry doesn't solve nothing and that ended up everyone trust me things, because they know that I'm very positive and security."
"How has ever dated and never missed their ex, shoot the first rock."
"When we are in love, inside of us, a feelings confusion that we are lost."
"I dated a boy named Luan, he's 3 months younger than me, and maybe my biggest mistake was start like this, because woman matures early than man."
"But we kept a perfect relationship, it was of giving envy to all."
His friends started hate me because he only wanted to stay with me.
"We only cared about our opinion, and we dated for 9 months."
"On a certain day, we fight, and I didn't hold and broke up."
"After that, we dated once in a while, hiden, so nobody would get in the way."
"However, I couldn't stand it, being treated like friend in front of others to later when we were alone have any type of touch."
"Pay attention young man, she laugh of your most idiotic jokes."
She is interested for all your without head or tail subjects.
"So, there she is to put up with you talking about ordinary things, she just want to see your mouth move and the sound of your voice come out."
"He doesn't care about listening your love complaints, as much it pains a lot, she will always be there, to support you."
She only cares to see you well.
"When she fills your patience, don't fight, she only likes to see you a little angry, because she knows that you later will open a smile, and she loves that smile."
"I see that I'm surrounded by fake people, lying bastards men, when I think that I found someone different, it's deception, just another fake and lier."
"I will learn to live whiout you, and if God wants, I will also be happy."
I will always fondly remember about everything I've lived with you.
"Zootechnicians are professionals responsable by the study and control of reproduction, genetic enhancement and nutrition of animals created for commercial purposes, aimed to raise the production and upgrade the quality of animal origin products."
They realize experiments with food and research ways of ensuring the hygienic conditions and to prevent and combat diseases and parasites to improve flock health and the quality of the derived products.
They also work as rural administrators and farms planners and rural instalations.
Cholesterol-free eggs and light pig meat are examples of what genetic research can do in search of healthiest foods.
"A lot of time confused as a veterinarian, the zootechnician is, actually, the professional focused on production development."
"You travelled, is far from me."
I can't stop thinking about you.
"Because, I don't know if I will hold the miss."
"Ah! My darling, you are my half."
"I kill the time, writing in this online diary."
I'm anxiously waiting for you.
Only you makes me smile.
I want your strong hug soon.
"Is it just me, that never had a cute and perfect boyfriend even if it was just for a month?"
"In my love life, everything is a BIG shit."
"When the guy is interested in me, sometimes I'm not interested on him or everyone is and doesn't work, something happens and that's it."
"I know that I have to wait, but I waited too much."
"This is the first register that I make here, and at this moment there isn't too much what to talk about personal life, so, I will reproduce something I wrote in a message."
"Stay there and I stay with my breasts, with hard and protruding nipples, crazy to be licked from up to down, from one side to the other, to be bitten lightly and sucked entirely."
"Nipples that can be soft like breats, that are puffed up and proud of being so fluffy."
"These breast that do not fit inside one hand, spread out between fingers, that hope they squeezes them tight, fingers that enter through the bra, appearing through the naughty cleavage of the red shirt, and inside the bra he squeeze them sweetly, gently, groping and pushing out everything that inside burns and palpitates strongly."
"Soft mouth, greedy, warm, that will try swallow it all and won't make it, will lick it entirely to compensate the fact that he can't touch it entirely with the mouth."
"His hands enfolding them while the mouth don't stop licking them like were ice cream, because almost melt in your mouth."
"And these nipples become more and more hard, causing a impatient excitement, a little nervous, of getting wer from so anxiety."
"My heart accelerates, my hands become cold and little flickering, gives me a chill in my stomach, and a weird sensation when he is close, and especially when we are alone, or even in the crow, when he hugs me and say: ""You are beautiful today""."
"At the moment, I am at a loss, and the shyness takes over me and when I realized, I'm already on your arms."
"I just totally forget where am I, and stop caring with people around, when I'm with him, it's like if exist only us there."
I think that live a romance is much more cooler than just a bid.
"Romance is for an indefinite time, while a bid has his times counted."
"I am enjoying loving, and being loved, best thing that have is to be corresponded in relation to good feelings."
"May it be eternal while it lasts, and that is lasts forever."
"To you, I'm completely in love, wish you all good feelings, all good companies."
"May the love to the next and the will of knowledge be your ""little mark"" in this beautiful illuminated spirit."
"May you bring with you, love, knowledge, peace, calm and justice spirit."
"May you teach me to be more human and the real meaning of love, since now forgive me for my excesses towards you, but may this beautiful opportunity, be taken and god help us daily to be ""mother and son"", let my beloved son come."
"I remeber so many moments, so many good things that we made together, you were an angel to me."
"I can't remember right how I met you, but I know that was the best day of my life, you to me and more than a friend, it's a sister from a diferrent family."
You don't know how much I became bad for you changing school.
I want you do well in life and love someone that also loves you a lot.
We are starting to move away and you didn't notice.
"But know that I miss you so much, I miss your smile."
"Dude, I can't take Douglas anymore, annoying boy!"
"I mean, he had disappeared, now he came back again to annoy me."
"I don't treat him badly, but dude, he only talk bullshit, I already said that I don't want to be with him, but he insists in a way that suffocates me."
"I really wanted his friendship, but he always comes back with second intentions, I'm almost giving a end to this, I mean on another way, excluding him."
"And  like that, I became DISGUSTED with him, that I don't even understand why."
"He would stick his tongue down my throat, that I almost died."
"Just imagine us together, makes me want to vomit."
"Today, I will go out with some friends."
"I love them because they are very nice and funny, we love laugh and make fun."
"On the way to this girl's house, we found a man lying on the floor like if he was dead or passed out , the strange thing was that the man had his eyes were half open and face up."
"I found it very strange and became really affraid, even though we passed through the man and kept walking."
"My girl senses said there was something wrong, so I asked Lucas and Victor come back there with me and try wake the man up to know if he was alive."
"But I wanted to come back anyway, so we came back."
"The boys were trying to wake the man up in all forms, nothing of he awaking, so I decided waking him up myself."
"I moved him, shook him, turned him over and nothing of the man waking up, until I saw a bottle next to his head, I decided grab it and drop the liquid inside of it in man's head, then he wake up."
My mother had one of that fights with me because of sleep schedules.
"And the crybaby here spent the night crying, until get puffy eyes."
"Thinking that the only way to my parents don't fight with me would be I dying, then I wouldn't bother anyone."
Took another antidepressant pill (normally I only take two) and went to listen to music.
"After some time, I was dancing happily, as if nothing was happening."
"And was like that until 5 in the morning, when I finally decided go to sleep."
"And no, it wasn't the remedy, because he takes a lot to take effect, it's not like that from one moment to the next."
"Well, the important thing is that I'm better."
Today I made an appointment at the gynecologist.
"We never had sex, but I think is closer than far."
"I'm a virgin, or at least I never had a penetration."
"The only thing we made was oral sex, he on me."
"Sometimes I kinda feel bad for being so dependent of others, not knowing how to do anything by myself."
"I become jealous of my friends who solve everything by themselves, know how to go everywhere, and in a good way."
The university schedules were terrible.
"She keeps throwing in my face that I can't do anything, then I get this in my head, and leave me even more impotent."
"I fight with him and excluded everything, but in another week I saw more and more cartoon porns."
"C'mon guys, I don't like this, I don't know, I think is a lack of respect with me!"
"But she is very special, she is my best friend."
"With that end of term in college, he felt terrible."
"It was seminar, exam and work all together, I was to get crazy, even more me, that hates talk in public."
"I don't have way, I stutter, forget, all."
"There was one subject that I reached the limit of absences; another that I baraly didn't pass; there was a work that I didn't even saw the color, but they put my name, on seminars I saved myself for the sake of the others."
"Had a time that I gave up and started to cry, but I talked with the teacher and she gave me a huge alternative work, so I wouldn't get a zero."
I felt super bad about everybody presented well and I presented badly.
"Since is public, the level is very high."
And my inferiority just increase in these cases.
My psychologist asked me if I wanted a second opinion (either to see the medication question or to see if I really had Bordeline Personality) and I agreed.
I went to the psychiatrist and she gave me risperidone.
"I decided to accept, because I was really terrible (I'm still, but at least now that I entered on vacation I was able to give it some relief)."
"I've always been very perfectionist, I always like give the best of me, especially in the intellectual performance aspect."
I want to compensate what my classmates from college did for me.
"In a moment, nobody will want to call me anymore to thr groups, if I stay bad like this."
"I want to drive a car, be independent, be a successful psychologist."
"At least, the college subjects are going to be cooler and more related with the course."
"On Saturday, July 28th, was a wonderful Saturday."
"I met a guy, kind, handsome and funny."
"Maybe I met him two or more weeks ago, don't remember."
But I perfectly remember that he told me he really liked me.
I was not surprised and no big deal.
I was already accustomed to knowing that a lot of boys already declared to me.
The worst is I also liked him.
"You can think I'm crazy, I liked a boy that I met on the Internet."
"I've already got tired of running behind who doesn't deserve, now if he wants me come after me, you know where to look me and where to find me."
"They don't think like girls. So, don't treat them as ""friends""."
"Men are naturally territorial, are jealous and hunters!"
"It was just wink, that I fell in love at last, and in the middle of the smoke, he also liked me."
"Yes, I'm a preppy!"
"I'm sure a pround, don't be with everyone (even because this is a slut thing), play scoccer, talk with talks to me, also I'm not of having many friends!"
"At my school, there are a bunch of rockers and the preppies that were there normally became sluts!"
"I'm one of the only respectful preppies, that like red and are not example of sluts."
"Last year carnival, had a celebration at school, all classes are reunited, I preferred to read a book in the library, there was the music teacher there plus about three rockers as well."
"I entered, excused myself, and picked up a romance book!"
There was a boy that was directly staring at me and that was bothering me.
I don't consider myself a lucky person.
I also consider myself a person with feelings.
"But, the biggest one, is the hate."
"Many think that I am wrong, and I'm talking a bunch of crap, by saying that there is a great hatred present in me."
"But these people are only countless mortals who say whatever they want, literally, they don't know anything about me, and much less, about what I think."
"Not that I consider myself an immortal, to me, everyone has the same fate."
"But in recent times, has been happening weird things to me."
My family never cared to what happens or stops happening to me.
"In fact, nobody cared to even know if I was okay, or I was needing help."
Noboby ever cared about me.
"Love letters usually don't start like this, with explanations and reasons."
But I wouldn't have it any other way something I feel without trying or give reasons even if loving exempts any kind of explanation and doesn't need reasons to happen.
"I think love arises I don't know where, grows I don't know why and hurts without wanting you maybe is my only hope... or the last."
"Not because I can't fall in love again but because I will always wish one person, this person will be you!"
That will be in my dreams you're different!
"Is the only responsable of what I feel, give myself totally to you, if you want to I can give your name to some star or give this star to you."
"I can try to stop the wind or sit in the spring breeze, I can try stop the Sun or make you have a perfect day, can try and do so many things for you, less than you love me more than I LOVE YOU."
"Well, if love is thinking about you 24 hours a day, going out on street thinking that I can crossing paths with you at any moment and close the eyes and see your face, it can even be love!"
"And everyday I'll look at sky and will thank for finding you and for you have been more than I expected, I will be thanked by your look."
"In this terrible state of depression that that I was, I don't know what else to do from so much despair, I felt an inconsolable pain, it hurted a lot, more than anything, or almost everything."
"I found a solution, or better, in my head was the only solution."
I started to cut my pulse in order to bring physical pain and forget the emotional pain.
Incredibly as it seems that made me stronger.
"My friend Laura, the dumbest and most stupid of all started to cut herself in the middle of the classroom."
"Holy shot again, she was caleed to the board, gave the names of everyone that was in the game, and they were all called, one by one as if we were at the police station. "
"Then they found out that we all cutted ourselves, they thought that was some kinda of pact. They called our parents, but only only Laura's and my mother went there and found out about it."
"My weekend was reasonable, let's say I expected a little more."
"Last night, my boyfriend came here to the house, didn't go out, we stayed at home."
"And like always, there was one more DR."
"But this time it was kind of nice, I talked a lot, I think he understood my side."
"Actually, I think I was able to express clearly what I was feeling."
"It was nice, after a lot of conversation we were flirting, amazing how that boy has the gift of drive me crazy and at the same time make me happy."
"The moments by your side are always perfect, you know."
"When you kiss me is as if millions of lights shone in my world, I feel myself floating on your arms."
When you hug me I feel myself protected.
As if no external problems could hit us!
I'm sure that is called LOVE..
And is amazing how this feeling makes me feel good and bad at the same time.
"Today I felt myself very lonely and instead of crying, as usual, I mutilated myself."
"Hit myself a lot, and I bit myself 3 times."
"I don't recommend this to anyone, but can't think on on something else to do when I'm sad, because my friends and relatives don't understand that I become sad for no reason and will call me a beast and if I tell anyone that I mutilated myself they'll call me sick, because this is what the human being do, judge each other."
Life was given to us freely.
The reaction power is inside of each of us.
"To be happy, there is not magic potion."
"It's only necessary that you have a clean soul, free of sorrows and grudges."
Each one is free to fulfill his mission in the way he wishes.
"The Happiness is always knocking our door, just open it and invite her in."
We always have iluminated souls extending our hand.
"Alive, happy and communicative, these geminian beings, light and carefree, they always seem to be well with everyone."
"Friendly as they come, will always give the impression that are interested in someone, but they are only talking and looking for information."
"The geminian are always very expressive and talk a lot with the hands, always telling facts that happened with so vivacity."
"Your walking is a little bouncy and happy, and they always do a lot os things at the same time, like  study while watching TV and speaking at phone while talking to you."
"In reality, it's not that they are following the fashion: they are always in fashion."
"I'm very organized, paranoid, I'm disgusted by almost everything."
"I love kids, and sometimes I really look like them, I love play, jump, in short... mess, I love happy and different things."
The truth is that I'm really intense and there's no one to fix it.
I vibrate with joys that don't belong to me.
"The good thing about it all is, every night before I sleep, I pray."
And always smile!
The miss is the biggest prove that the pass was worth it.
"Really, I am not in the mood to groom myself, take care of myself, the bad thoughts take over my head and I enter in a desperation state."
"I lent the money to my father and sincerely, I regret this a lot."
"Diego sent me away, didn't care about me anymore, my mother turned her back to me, I only had my father and he asking me to take the money from bank, making the most psychological pressure, wouldn't I take it?"
"Although, now it's no different, because he is with me anyway out of pity."
"Now, I'm here with my cards, they all have to be parceled out (I will pay the triple because of the fees), without any penny and on top of that, with Diego fighting with me and throwing at my face that I'm stupid and lent the money to my dad."
"He doesn't understand why he never had to go through such a difficulty, but I'm sure thet if was his mother in my father's place, he would have done the same."
"Diego, in turn, instead of being a present boyfriend, who supports me, advises me and tries to understand my side and helps me, only knows how to judge me and fight with me because of it."
"Yesterday, I was with my best friend in classroom, I arrived late and talked a little with my best friend."
Then that crazy one that I mentioned that day when I made a fool of myself and she didn't let me talk with my best friend.
"Then, the crazy one talked to her and I didn't understand the talk between them but ended up being quiet."
The portuguese class was boring.
"Hours were passing, we went to video room, it was gym class, damn it!"
I wanted to go to the court but the teacher wanted us to stay in the video room and the boring movie.
"You promised me, I know, I remember, you swore you would be forever."
"You also swore, that would forgive my mistakes and my flaws, that any slip I may have had, you would forgive, because the good that I had done to him, would outweigh any pain."
"Forgive me, I made unforgivable mistakes, as I already forgave, I committed exaggerated slips, and it wasn't the first time, I lied for fear of his reaction, fear that you would abandon me, I fought a lot with this feat at my side, which did me no good, the fear only made me lose you."
"I can't hide the sadness anymore, and the tears already took care of my eyes."
"I'm without ground, without way, without dreams."
"I found myself empty, hopeless and after all I've done to you, without courage to ask to stay with me."
"I love you so much, I wanted you to know that, to realize my acts of love, affection, dedication that I have shown to you."
I think about the future because this will be good to me and for everyone I love.
"I'll gratuate, work, do the possible to keep the peace in my house."
I don't intend to make a serious commitment to anyone.
"We think differently, have differents goals."
"I'm from a family that the father always sustained the house to raise the children, while my mom stayed at home taking care of us."
"We didn't have all, but the essential to become responsible adults!"
"I've a lot of friends, I am an extroverted person, happy, I love to see people happy around me, pray a lot for Health, because if we have it, we run after the rest."
"My husband is Materialist, Grumpy, I say almost BIPOLAR, a good father yes, but not a good husband."
"I don't have many friends, and ends up being even many times selfish, if he needs, bypasses someone in order to gain something."
"To me the simpler things of life are the best, I love visits."
And make someone happy has more value than knowing about my life.
"I'm very happy abut the approval, even knowing that it wasn't really deserved."
"But this time everything turned out well, after so many pain and so many suffering by circumstances, all ended up, well."
"And that affected me a lot, I became totally angry."
I still remember the sweet words that you used to say.
"I remember the smile you used to open when you saw me, the explanations that you used to give when you couldn't call."
"I still remember the times you looked at me and told me how much you loved me, how much you wanted me."
I still remember the times you looked at me and said the fear you felt of losing me.
I still remember how much satisfaction that I had in see you smile.
"I still remember all I lived with you, and I miss those nights of ours where you told me your joys and agonies."
"I have been remembering those conversations, those laughs and also our secrets."
"I always remember your smile, when I arrived sad, I felt embraced by him."
"I also remember, how you were able to ease my pain."
"How I wish I could go back in time, have you by my side, with your iluminated look."
"I kept them all in my memory, they won't be forgotten."
"Our ways changed, but weren't lost; I'm still here, and the best of all, is that I'm sure you are still out there too."
"If you need, look look for me; if you miss me, call; if you have any problem, count on me; and if you have some time, let's see each other!"
"I don't have that young appearance anymore, but my heart still is the same you loved, that gave you affection, and love receiving yours."
"We may see each other tomorrow, we may not meet for another year, maybe time push us further apart, but I want you to know that I remembered you today."
"I promise to love you until the end of my life, until my last breath, until my last heart beat, until the last tear of my face."
"Because now I know that it's you who my heart really chose, it's for whom I will fight until the infinity and wish all the time, in all my dreams, in all my wishes, in all my prayers."
"I feel this wish every day you know, even when I do, but hours late I'm already want to do hot love."
"My little guard angel who was called Douglas, besides being handsome it was my best friend!"
Because friends also say I LOVE YOU!
I can't think about him without having a laugh!
"He called all the boys I said I was friend, of idiot, he wasn't a bad friend, which is in the foot, but has never let me do something wrong!"
"He was, and always will be my best friend, because he is not visible, but is alive in my heart!"
"This is a place of much venting and I feel like a bit of a 'mommy' to many who write, because I'm older than most of the girls here."
"Most of the ones who treat to do it, don't do, but if you are thinking, I have a report to give."
A colleague killed herself before she was 30!
It was a scare for many people!
Separated from husband and couldn't take it!
"When I was 5, I almost died!"
I had appendicitis with serious complications.
"Actually, it's a miracle that I'm alive."
And it will be selfishness of your part let the others solve it.
I can't see a hot blonde in front of me that I already get horny!
"So, I don't know what else to do, give myself up to death or wait a little more?"
Indirection affects my bad mood and only makes you more repugnant to me.
"Me and my boyfriend now, have been a lot of time together, and we still have that dream of sleeping together, and waking up next to each other, you know."
And he even fucks you BY THE HAND and he even licks the lips by how good it was.
"It was all so intense, a month felt like years."
I returned to my reality and then my summer romance had to come to an end because of the responsibilities of the real world.
I feel like part of me was in another place.
Looking forward to a close hug and a kiss on the forehead.
"My mind says that is madness to wait so long, but my heart says that is possible."
Today I missed everyone and the place where I stayed very much.
"Almost two months made me have a routine, very crazy, but a cool routine."
"I belive that because of this, this vacation was perfect."
It was a gift from heaven.
"Traveling with friends, without any family members around was the best thing I ever did."
I really miss this freedom right now.
This story talks about the relationship between women.
"I woke up late, with that desire to stay in bed, that desire to do nothing, simply, vegetate!"
"I hate feel lazy, keep blaming myself for not enjoy the world when I1m not doing anything, but in the last few weeks I feel a great desire to sleep and forget the world around me."
"My car that I would like to buy will have to wait, after all I didn't know that thing for house would be so expensive, everything seemed like a dream or a nightmare."
"Arriving there, Helen welcomed me with a smile, but something in your look was different, she soon told me that Erika was there with some friends disassembling the furniture."
"As soon as she comes up, Erika will look at you with  those disapproving eyes."
"As night fell we headed for the hotel closest to the house, with a good apperance, I was more comfortable to spend the night."
"We went upstairs and entered room 42, a mirror in front, large bathroom with old ceramics, in the bedroom a huge bed, the atmosphere was similar to a motel, but a little less cheeky."
"She took off the blouse in the direction of the bathroom, I kept looking at her curves, she was not skinny but not overweight either, when I heard the shower turning on I felt my body getting warmer, I knew that were the first symptoms my body gave of excitement."
"I entered in the bathroom and took off my clothes, looking in her eyes I asked if I could entered, shook her head with a mischievous smile and gestured that yes, ran her hand over my body."
"We woke up really early, went back to her home, soon the truck would arrive to take the move, had taken on a big responsibility."
"Seeing those suitcases all packed, I realized what I was doing and was really a madness I was starting to like."
"I had already loved someone who never loved me, I did everything for my ex, and from a day to other she left me, it hurts a lot love and have to live by crumbs, and on this short life I already suffered a lot, so why not correspond to Helen?"
"Why not make her happy, since she was also willing to make me happy."
"Now with a more open heart, I followed the truck towards the new house, and after thirty minutes we were close."
"Life was cruel with me, since I was a little girl she has been working as a shoeshine, starving and seeing everyone with father and mother, and me an orphan with living parents."
"I realized that there was almost no sun, and the biggest difficulty would be the clothes, I realized that Helen wasn't happy, but I knew that I would help her, my money was already running out, and she, with her name in ruins and swamped with bills, couldn't help me any time soon."
We barely started and the financial problems started.
"Maturity knocked on my door early, I had to put food on the table early."
"As long as I have the strength I fight, I think that's why I got a good job early on, I relate very well with people, of course the beauty of being of Indian and Italian descent makes the difference."
"That night, I slept with her, the fights in my house were constant, I couldn't participate in my classes, I was far away from my family, and to help with this, my mother and I hit it off a lot."
"I moved back in with her when I was 11 and was abandoned by my aunt, our relationship was very difficult, she repeated millions of times that I was not her daughter, that I was a mistake that happened."
"Until I couldn't stand it any longer and started to hit it head on, left home without direction, many times, and for the first time at the age of twelve I found out what depression was."
"My mom called talking a lot, that I was a irresponsable and things couldn't stay like that."
"Our first weekend arrived, I did the market, prepared lunch, did the laundry, wow everything was so delicious, and she was so happy, despite everything she always told me she was happy, and asked me every day to marry her."
"I only remember the phone being switched off, I knew hat I had lost my family at that moment."
"That day in the morning was torturous, I knew my mom would talk a lot, she bursts out of nowhere and doesn't stop, when she fights with my dad almost hit him."
"At this moment I felt my life ending, my heart was broken into billions of pieces, everything I had conquered lost, everything I had been was no more, tears streamed from my face."
"I was angry with myself, that I was giving up everything for someone else, that I let her talk to me like that, talk about her like that."
"I came back to the service hearing only her martyrdoms, trying to hide my cry face, but deep down, I was more lost than a whore in a convention."
"The 6 o'clock pointer knocked, and the cab was waiting for me, I went inside the house again, hoping that it was all a dream."
"I wanted to die, didn't know how to name what I was feeling, it was a mixture of fear, despair, and a huge feeling of loneliness, I have always been lonely."
"Wow, how thin you are, beautiful. Let's go out to buy some pants, I always do that with your sister, I think we can do it."
"It was wonderful, perfect, for a moment I got the attention that my sister had without effort."
"Now after three years I see myself in front of the toilet, I didn't make any kind of effort, I simply vomited like in the old days."
"Couldn't respond, I didn't cry, I didn't smile, I simply sat on the bathroom floor staring at nothing, with an eternal sense of well-being in the midst of the emptiness that tormented me."
"I woke up with Helen looking at me, I knew she was not well either, but at that moment she was the only person I had and I was the only person she had, I took a bath, changed and was already on my way out."
"Everything is gonna be alright! I will arrive home early today, will prepair the noodles that you like so much, wants drink something, slept whiout eating anything."
"During the day, I could see my brother by the window, a pretty blonde boy, we are more than sinblings, we share secrets, he is my accomplice and I'm his one."
"And thus another month passed, didn't eat, didn't live, vegetated, and at the end of the day vomited, Helen locked herself into the world of accounts using my card, was no longer caring about anything either."
"My uncle was coming back from Panana, where the aunt that raised me lived, asked to talk to me a very delicated subject."
The night was coming when I heard the knock on the door.
"Of course, I came back from my trip because I would like to know how you are, I brought unpleasant news about your aunt."
"You will always be that little girl with blonde hair and the most beautiful smile of the universe, don't forget."
"I closed the door, Helen looked at me scared, I didn't say anything, I just went to the bathroom, turned on the shower, got in with my clothes and everything, tears mixed with the shower water, the door is opened."
"I can't, my life is over, I don't know what to do."
"In the following week it was raining a lot, I woke up during the night frightened, the house was full of water, at bed height."
"In a few minutes, Helen cummed in a way that I have never seen, it was true, it was more than a simple sex."
"After that experience, everytime she wanted that I was a man in bed, and then I started to question why these attitudes."
"Two days after the flood I started to have strong muscular pains, and the fever was not constant, seven days passed, I went to work my eye was huge, I thought I had pinkeye, I asked to be excused from work, and as I was leaving I had a big surprise, it was my sister looking at me."
"My God, that's why she is so red, I think she has a fever, but why doesn't she go to the health center?"
"He gave me a big hug, a kiss and said he loved me, I opened a smile."
"Everyone in the room, including my dad, got up, the concern was visible on everyone's face."
There I was able to reconnect with my family and get Helena to connect too.
"I have everything that a little teenage can have, friends, people who love me, ""money"", popularity, I have all."
"I don't have the touch of your hand gliding over my body, I don't have your hugs, I don't have your kisses, I don't have you in my life."
"I do all that is under my reach, because to my life be perfect you are the only one missing in it."
"Gee, today I'm embarrassed and very, very HATE me."
"You know, today when I was leaving the garage at home, I accidentally crashed the car and scratched it on the back, gee, I feel like crap."
"And my husband saw and called my attention and quite rightly, because I am very distracted and STUPID for having done that and I admit that I'm wrong and I am so ashamed of him and myself for having done this."
I know that was a accident but I have the obligation of paying a little more attention.
I'm with an immense desire to beat myself up because I hate myself so much.
Yesterday I had a wonderful night with my husband.
Won't be hard to me write this guide.
"When you fall in love for a shy girl, I knew that she can be but will never take initiatives not even to look you in the eye."
"So, you are the one who will have to go there and talk to her, anything, normally say ""Hi"" the ""How are you"" and bring up an interesting subject, nothing too personal."
"If the both of them end up getting along by talking, probably, this will be a sign that she is liking talk to you and is thinking you are a nice person, this is very important to work well."
"So, if you don't see each other anymore, call her and ask her out for a talk."
"She might even get a little clumsy, but, if the talk be pleasant to her, I'm sure she will accept the invitation;"
"Don't be quiet during the date, will keep her quiet too, and if she feels like to say something to you, she might get embarrassed and keep quiet, so always be making good subjects."
"When you ask her to be your girlfriend, don't play the hard guy because this doesn't work with shy girls, be direct, talk to her by getting exactly to the point."
"After she finally accepts, all red with shame, that's a hint, never let her feel pressured by you, if someone make a silly joke that can make her feel bad, defend her at that time, always bring good subjects, I repeat."
"I'm sorry for not taking care of you right, little one."
"I thought that some ordinary things, were the most important."
Sorry for having made such a big and unforgivable mistake.
"I was so idiot, in valuing after losing."
"But I still, know that if I would just play with you, as always, you would forget everything, and cheer me up, as you always did."
Remember that Christmas that I spent alone?
"My father preferred my stepmother to me (despite I had gotten used to this, it was the first time he had ever done it)."
You were there to help me when I needed.
"You licked my tears, and slept by my side everytime I cried until fall asleep."
"On Easter, there were we, in the same year, alone at home again."
"You were always there when I needed, yes, I feel that I should repeat this."
"How many people are really worth it to meet, and are your real friends?"
"When my parents divorced, I had nothing left."
"I think that I was already mature to be eight or nine years-old, sincerely."
"Only you knew that I didn't cry for being alone on those dates we used to celebrate, but I cried because my father was all that left for me, and was simply his second option."
"So, I have you left."
"You were simply stolen from me, right?"
"I knew that you had disappeared somehow, but I wanted avoid this, wanted to lie for myself."
"The truth hurts, always has"
"Then, my dad simply arrived ans said something like ""Your heartless, haven't you noticed that your dog is no longer there, that it has been stolen?""."
"Still, at that time I looked for you."
Looked like never before.
"I looked for all sides of the garden, and walked wering pijama by the street of Curitiba looking for you."
"At night, I cried."
"I cried more than at Christmas and Easter, I swear I cried."
"I don't know how was possible, but I cried for 6 hours without stopping."
"It did not improve the situation my father seeing me crying and start yelling ""stop crying, what a childish thing"" and fight with me, call me everything."
"I simply thought ""He is not seeing that I just lost everything I had?"""
I felt myself the most groundless person in the world.
"Dog, thanks for being there while I suffered bullying, and became anorexic because of stupid and trivial comments that wouldn't change my life if I didn't care."
"Thanks for being there when I thought in kill myself, I looked at you, and thought ""I have to stay to take care of you."""
"Nobody belives, and some even laugh, when I say that my dog was everything and nothing for me, and that saved me from suicide, but I think that by reading this text, some would understand."
"I still spend all Christmas, from then on alone, and Easter too."
"Not because they want, the whole family simply forgets my existence."
"My mother won't even let me go out with her, and she takes my sister, and then she complains that she is the 'unloved' of the story."
"Well, these days, I always miss you."
"I regret for crying before, having you by my side, nd now I feel that I have real reasons to stay like this."
"Thank you for changing my life, and saving it."
"Sincerely, without you, I would be already dead."
"This is a phrase that I often say to someone who asks about my life, but no one understands."
There are few that I explain myself.
"It has to be for someone who really deserves the story, and has the patience to hear it."
"Now, I'm sustained by memories, you know?"
"I don't have you anymore, I think it's what is left for me."
I can't attach myself to friends who I know won't be with me as they say they will.
"I attach myself for memories because a lot of them don't come back, many people changed, but the memories didn't."
"When I looked back, he barked, wagged his tail and made a sexy pose that seduced me, I want him."
"I don't know if you remember that, but I do."
"I don't know if you are alive, but I know that wherever you are, you're in my heart, and I'm with you little one."
"That promise I made to you that Christmas, and hugged you tight."
"I still have your collar, your dog pots, everything that belonged to you."
"I don't dare throwing away nothing of that, because is all that rest from you, right?"
"Maybe I will donate it, to a dog that needs love."
"Would be evil to lack for one, while I have and I just don't give it away because I'm attached to it."
"It's in my heart and soul, and I know you are watching over me, little one."
The boyfriend is not mine.
"Well, I have wanted for a long time to get off my chest what I THINK about a FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND, one of my CLOSEST friends."
"I've already said somethings to her, but it's complicated talk about someone else's boyfriend, right?"
"She has been dating for almost 4 years, has already broken up once, but only briefly."
"They live in different cities, but close to each other."
And he doesn't care if her parents don't like.
He doesn't care about anything.
"He is 20 years old, didn't finish high school (BECAUSE HE IS LAZY), DOESN'T WORK, and he's a fanatic about the gym."
"Anywhere they go, the bill is ALWAYS split, equally between both of them."
She can't go on the Internet when he is at her house (unless it's VERY FAST) because she has to be WITH HIM the whole time.
"She can't go out here without him, only stay at home!"
"Never dated at a distance, but I think that wouldn't be easy!"
He turns off the cell phone at dawn and the next day says the battery is dead.
"Go out at dawn and says that went buy a ""pastry""."
"The funny thing is also that he almost never has any money to spend on my friend, always has to split it, but for TRADEMARK CLOTHES, TATOOS AND gym he always has!"
"The funny thing is also that he almost never has any money to spend on my friend, always has to split it, but for TRADEMARK CLOTHES, TATOOS AND gym he always has!"
She herself has already said that he is super MATERIALIST and he is always very concerned about himself.
"They don't trust each other, she already told me clearly that she doesn't trust!"
"Last night when I arrived from the course and was about to have dinner I felt one of those pains that I always feel in my leg, my leg paralyzed, Fernanda took me to the room where my father was having his dinner, when I went into the room I started shaking and feeling dizzy and a buzzing in my ear followed by numbness in my hands."
"Nanda called the SAMU but it didn't do much good as they couldn't come, but my father took me to UPA, there I was treated very fast, the doctor didn't know what I had and prescribed me medicine to stop my shaking, the medicine was intravenous, which means I had to take it along with intravenous serum."
"Then my panic, I couldn't take the medicine, I was very nervous and affraid, my father didn't understand my the phobia I have of needles and fought with me in front of the nurses."
"My father held me by my arm and wanted to take me to take the medicine, by that time I was in a panic crisis and couldn't stop crying and couldn't even think straight anymore."
"I came back home, my father fought with me, only my sister understood what I was feeling, I cried almost the whole night."
"I suffered a lot for not being able to take the medicine and even more by the brutality of my parents, for don't understand that who has phobia is not being fussy."
"Yesterday I discussed with my older sister, she is very annoying and nosy."
"Yesterday, she was at work and cousin said that she had chocolate."
"Well, today I start to write my virtual diary, since I don't have a single friend to listen to me when I need it."
"My name is Edvania Lemos, I'm married and habe a 12 years old son."
I married early and I don't think that was a good choice.
"When we are young and fall in love, we see everything in a fantasy mode and full of tgood things and then we give ourselves by body and soul in  the life we think it's perfect."
"Anyway, this is how my dilemma begins, I had a boyfriend at 14 and stayed with him until I was 16, got pregnant and everything went down the drain."
I was very nauseous and my poor boyfriend was the one I was most nauseous with and that's why we drifted apart and with only 4 months of pregnancy each one literally went their separate ways.
"They were wonderful with me, supported me and helped me in everything."
But by my own conscience I decided to support my child myself.
"Well, when my son completed 5 months, I met a friend of my sister, at first it was a friendship but with less than 15 days we had our first kiss and wow what a delicious kiss, done, it was passion for sure."
"He immediately assumed me and my son that was still a baby, and was all perfect!"
"Wow, he was so gentle and passionate, took care of my son and me like a real man, he literally assumed, it even seems that my son was his biological son, a perfect father like everyone should be."
"We kept on dating until my son completed one year, so we got married, bought our house and started a life together."
"Everything was fine, he was in the army, didn't earn much, but it was enough, after 2 years married he was promoted to sargent and of course everything got better financially."
The sex wasn't so good anymore and my husband was very quiet and still with me.
"In relation to our son, he didn't change nothing, he always fulfilled the role he took on perfectly, a great father, I would never complain about that."
"One afternoon, he arrived saying that he needs to go to an event at the barracks."
"He even showed irritation because said that wasn't really in the mood to go, but said that it was was necessary."
"Me as the good wife I have always been, I passed his best uniform, I shined his boots, made him look and smell nice, he gave me a kiss and left."
"He arrived 00:30, I was waiting for him anxiously, because we always slept together and that's why I was waiting for him."
"When he entered, it was weird, he went straight to the shower, didn't even kiss as usual, I found it strange, but we made love and slept."
"That happened at Wednesday night, and on Sunday I was making lunch and my husband was watching football with my son."
"Then, someone clapped his hands at the basement, that's where my life would fall apart, it was a man, and my husband he went to answer and gee, he was pale and nervous, I didn't understand why, I stayed on the door, how great was my disappointment and anguish."
"Hello, who never suffered for love and passion?"
"I think that most won't even answer, just for having gone through an experience so bad in relation to these."
"There are so many good or bad situations about love and passion, that there is no way to describe them all."
I like a boy for almost 3 years.
"In that time(that is not short), I had good and bad(more bad) moments and I can't seem to get out of it!"
"Even when this someone, gives evidences of how much he is not interested, you still finding ways to reverse it."
"When he makes it clear that he DOES NOT LIKE YOU, you cry or/and are sad for a few days, but later you think in some way to make him see how special you are."
"After once more get evidences that this someone doesn't want me, I've decided that I'm going to forget him."
"Nobody deserves humiliates himself, crying, at last, suffering for a person who does not value or does not want to receive your FEELINGS."
"This is the advise I left for you: VALUE YOURSELVES, EVERYONE HAS A SOUL MATE!"
"My love and I, were born to each other."
I'm upset and disappointed.
My mother assumed having prejudice with my boyfriend because he is black.
"I said to her that this makes no difference to me, but I feel that she doesn't support my relationship."
"Like, everything was going very well, very nice."
I decided cut my bangs.
Except for the fact that the idiot of the hairdresser made a mistake.
And cut my bangs in the middle of forehead and crooked
We deposit so much confidence and so much feeling into people.
"In people we thought we knew, but, in the end, only proved to be the same as everyone else."
"And for wait too much, dream too much, create too much expectations, we always end up disappointed and getting hurt more and more."
Attitude of a fool in love.
"But I really thought that everything would work out fine, that after opening my heart you would, you know, say that you feel the same, I swear I thought that would be like that."
"In my dreams, I imagined your mouth saying to me the words that would make me happy, that from that day on would be you and me forever."
"But that wasn't what happened and today not even friends we are anymore, a friendship of more than 5 years ended like that."
"But between being your friend or an acquaintance, I prefer bring yor friend, I miss our talks, laughs, jokes, anyway I miss you in my life!"
"I wanted to share with you about my dating, and say what many already said to me."
"I met my boyfriend on my 19 years old birthday, we made technical course at the same technical school, and a mutual friend introduced us."
"As I had already broke my face in another relationship (in fact, in almost all of them), I didn't care so much, but later I got to know him better and started to like him."
"Now, I'm 20 years old, and he will turn 29 in April, I prefer older guys, I'm happy with him and he is what matters."
"One time, I had been dating for less than a month when my niece was born, and my boyfriend went to the hospital to meet her and take the opportunity to meet part of my family, who adore him by the way."
"My mom took a picture of me with him, with my niece and our friend(the one that that introduced us) that works with him, she is 42 years old."
"Then my mom went home and I went to the course with my boyfriend and our friend, when I arrived, mom told me that she had posted the picture on her orkut page."
"My friend, I just saw the picture of Miih with her boyfriend on your orkut page, don't get me wrong, but he must be older than her."
This person who posted that is 56 YEARS OLD and WAS MARRIED WITH A 24 YEARS OLD GUY AT TIME.
I was POSSESSED!
"I almost curse that woman from top to bottom, it's very disrespecful, who is her to criticize my boyfriend?"
"Nothing against, of course, but people should see themselves more, at least is what I think."
"Then, the time passed, and I got into federal college(today I study in a particular one, subject for later) and right after I made friendship with the class."
A colleague grab my phone and saw my picture with my friend.
"My boyfriend doesn't seem to be that much older than me, but this annoys me, because love doesn't depend on age."
"If he was 50 years old and I loved him, I would be with him with no problem."
"I get upset, obviously it doesn't hurt my relationship these ridiculous comments, but I think that the human being should be less indiscreet and have more consideration with others."
"Lately I fight with my mother EVERY day, we fight about everything, even yesterday I was fighting with my younger sister, Bruna, for messing with my things, and my mother just fought with me."
My mother said that I'm very rebellious!
But I'm think it's because I'm reaching adolescence and everyone is like that in this phase of life.
5 years without the person who matters most to me in this world.
"5 years ago, I lost my reason, my hope, lost my will to live."
"But unfortunately, I don't have her, and I'm still alive, so I have to live, even without her."
"I continue, for her and with her."
"Love her more than everything in this life, so, I love my life."
"I must lift the head and move on, because I know she really wants this, to follow my dreams, to be someone. "
"And you can be sure, mom, I will make you very proud."
"Did you know that the boy who will appreciate you the most is the one who can't reach you, the one that look to you and and when you realize it, put the head down or smile, who can't look an eye for an eye, and when he talks to you, he smiles like a fool, and often ends up saying some things that have nothing to do with it, a bit silly, but did you know he does that because is trying to wipe a smile off your face?"
"And the reason he is very embarrassed to hit on you, is shyness."
"You knew these boys that barely say 'Hi', have the most true words to be said to you by the ear."
"They just hope that one day they will be able to say, an opportunity, a chance."
"So, why you girl don't stop of being interested in that boy who has courage to get close to you, talking about you appearance, looking at your body and complimenting you, trying to win you over by what you are on the outside."
"Because the same boy who has courage to talk with you, has enough courage to go and talk to another girl minutes later, and repeat the same words to get where he wants to go."
"While the shy boy spend hours practicing something to say when he sees you, and keeps remembering your smile, your look, even your way to talk, each expression of yours."
"The boy who doesn't have the courage to hit on you, has admired you for a long time from afar, and knows you more than you imagine, and much more than the guy who hits on you say."
"My friends found out, because they grabbed me by force and took off my coat to see what I was hiding so much."
But I only have this way to express what I feel.
"Today I am very calm, very calm."
"You know, I spent a big part of my life worried with everything, distressed, sad, and depressed."
"I thought about following the rules, plat the good boy role, worried about what others were thinking of me."
"Today, fuck that, I don't care for what you think about me, don't care about popularity, go tell lies in your fucking house, not in my ear."
"I don't care in appearing to be the good son, knowing that you are a terrible mother."
"Fuck my family, I didn't ask to be born in this shit, wants to talk bad, talk and then kiss up to me."
"I don't care to your authority, if you are my boss, my mom or president of Brazil, to talk with me, you ask please and then say thank you very much."
"Don't talk loudly to me, because nobody talk loudly with me."
My education depends in yours!
"I don't care about your car, your motorcycle or your wife, if I want, I run after."
I want you to put your envy and falsity in your ass.
"Don't come preaching to me about your god, I have my beliefs and don't need anyone honk in my ear to preach things that he himself does not practice."
"Don't come telling me to serve God, has to be in your goddamn church, punching money into your thief pastor's ass, and fuck you if you think that in going to hell because of that."
"Don't come talking about my religion you bastards, who are you to think anything, you pieces of shit, put the bible behind the arm and think that are serving God, and at home you curse your mother, only think about money, have sex with your girlfriend."
"Fuck soacial rules, I don't need to be perfect to anyone, I'm happy the way I am!"
"Fuck those who don't like me, do you think I depend in your friendship?"
"I don't need to tell you where I'm going to go or what I'm going to do, not even your shitty life worries me."
"I don't care for nothing, fuck it, I'm happy just the way I am!"
"Running down the street, coming back home all dirty by earth, playing games like hide-and-seek, cops and robbers, tag and hopscotch."
"I miss playing with dolls, watching Chiquitas on TV, and listening Sany e Júnior."
"Playing camp at my grandfather's house, and the strange foods he made!"
A time when we only went to school to play.
Playing of cooking with the neighbors!
"Going to my best friend's/brother's house just to watch TV, and bathe in his 1000 liter swimming pool."
Playing with little goal with my older brother.
"On rainy days or when I had nightmares, go running to my parents' bed, or sleep on the side of his bed and make my father sleep all night with his hand on top of me, otherwise I couldn't sleep ."
"My grandpa, teaching me the homework and trying take off my soft tooth."
School friendships were real.
Friendship declarations and the crazy draws in the school notebook.
"Just need to know how to live, know how to be free, love and be loved, know how to do and be happy!"
"Those who despise small events will never do big discoveries, little moments change big routes."
"Once more, I'm here whining, I am devastated, my husband lied to me, he created a Facebook profile hidden from me, added several women, including ex-girlfriends."
"I stayed up all night, cried a lot, thought even more, but, couldn't come to a conclusion, I want to drop everything and leave."
Moving back in with my parents and rub out my history with them.
"But I'm scared I can't do it, to regret, I'm afflicted without knowing what to think, I really wanted to get something off one’s chest to a friend but I don't have."
"What he did for me was cheating, it's really hurting me."
"Today my boyfriend is going to an anniversary, usually he comes to my house every single Saturday."
He is sad or I'm sad.
"Actually, I didn't even want to wake up today."
"The lie kills, but the doubt tortures."
"My friends came here to the house to make a pizza rodizio, very nice, ate a lot, watched movies, and are sleeping here now."
"I love my boyfriend, we went through so much together and he is without a doubt the best boyfriend that anyone can want."
"I've always been alone and looks like that I become alone each day, my head hurts and my tears can't stop."
"These feelings started when I was 14(I think), I don't know what went wrong in my life."
"When I was 14, I saw my parents fighting, my father leaving a lot of times, arguing with me, and I used to come home, you know, running to my room to cry."
"Anyone, neither my parents nor my brothers would know why I was crying, never."
"And it is like this until today, suffering, fighting directly with my parents."
"Today, my life is a big crap, I feel so imperfectly strange, a freak, I HATE MYSELF!"
"Because I'm not beautiful, because I'm a fool, because I'm not the way my mother wants me to be, I'm not like my family wants me to be."
"I hate when I'm so good and people take advantage of this, I hate, have to hide all my suffering, my pain and keep in my heart, I HATE MY LIFE!"
"And my life never was and never will be something that can be called life, my friends(colleges) seem to have a better life than I do, I don't want to have to hide that I am suffering anymore."
"I'M HAVING A BAD TIME, and family seems to see what I feel, they only complain, shout at me, hit me, I am getting so weak that I am surrendering to this feeling of pain."
"I discussed yesterday with my grandmother, my godmother, because she didn't trust me to go to the bakery buy bread,he sent my grandfather to follow."
"Enough, I can't take anymore, I discussed today with my aunt, with my mom, and I'm crying and it seems that I am alone again and as I always have been."
"My tears don't stop falling, and do you know what comes in my mind. dead."
"I feel so lonely and so hurt inside, my heart is broken, is reflected in the look in my eyes and I turn up the music so the neighbors don't hear my cries of pain, as if my world is falling apart."
"I see that the rain falls according to my tears, I see that the day is horrible and see the consequence in my body."
"Alone in a world where only fake feelings matter, where everyone belives in the lie for fear of admitting the truth, for fear that the truth is not what you expect."
"Rodrigo, my friend, he said that would come back to talk to me on MSN, I consider him a big brother to me."
"Ah, besides all the suffering that I am feeling now, there is also because my parents don't want me to date a person so special, you know."
"I want to stick to you and never let go, feel your hands drowning my hair and saying that love them again, hear your laugh."
"My day was good, woke up early, helped my mom and dad set up my little party, picked up my friends, ate a lot of barbecue and cake, and we had a good time."
I called Nando everyday to see if he would come to my party.
I became a little angry because he didn't answer my phone calls.
"Then, I asked my mom to let we go to cinema, she let, cut the cake and went to cinema, we watched The Avengers, very cool."
Bought my book.
I checked my cell phone as usual and saw a message there.
"When I read this message, I thought: 'I will call him and see how he is', and try try to advance what he wants to talk to me."
We started the conversation and everything right until he said that he would come back to see if they leave him leaning at work or is for him sign the resignation letter.
"My heart broke in millions of pieces, started to cry at that moment, he asked me to not cry, and said that it was hard for him too."
"He's only doing this because can't take his mother anymore and when fought, he took all his clothes and put them in a bag and made the biggest mess with him."
"Today, I woke up and saw your side of the bed empty."
Your smell is still there somehow in my imagination.
I always closed the window and fight with you because it was open.
"Now, the window is always open like you always asked me and didn't realise."
I fought with you for leaving TV and the lights from many rooms on.
"And now, they are all on and didn't realise."
Your side of the closet is empty and I didn't fill.
Your side of the cobbler was full of shoes that never ended and I always complained about about the mess.
"In the bathroom, your drawers are empty."
The window is not with your dozens of shampoos.
"In the closet, there is something left and I don't know if is yours."
"It's a travel toothbrush, that might my mother may have forgotten when she came take her stuff."
"On my computer, I have countless pictures of you."
I have countless picture of you with other people that I hate.
"I don't hate because they done somthing to me, but by the fact that you have given yourself to them."
"Despite all the hate,, I still miss you."
Holidays or weekends are coming up and I count the hours to go to my parents' house.
I haved been looking for friends and not even anyone.
"When I was with you, I complained that I had no time to for family and friends."
"Not, I simply don't complain about nothing, stay quiet keeping this all inside me."
The urge to cry comes back.
My eyes begin to fill with tears.
"Before meeting you, I had a lot of friends."
"I used to leave home early and came back very late, that was when I came back."
I was out in the world enjoying everything I could with no time to end.
I had no fears.
"I had loves, achievements."
"I used to do that, because I didn't know what was love."
"She goes with her friends, goes out with the boys."
I've already made that question and came back three times and today the suffering is a thousand times more.
"This time, I will have to be strong."
"I'm not a person to tell dreams or real facts, but since it was an experience of such proportions that I am giving up."
"I'm having a relationship with a person from the workplace, yes we work in the same company but in different places, describe him is to talk about a tall man, with a voice that make you all wet, yes it's a voice that no comments needed."
"His body is a spectacle with the right taste for more, his smile is so naughty as the owner himself."
"We were some day without contact, when he calls me asking if I have forgotten him and why I was gone."
"We went, to meet, but we were thirsty for each other, that I was feeling his member in me, this while, we were ""devouring"" each other with kisses that was mouth-watering just to see it."
He moaned the way that makes me very horny.
"When he turned me, kissed me so much that we started to cum together,"
"My body was shaking, more than his, I was on a shaky leg."
"We took a shower together and we started to dry ourselves, he throws me in bed and his mouth makes me moan."
"My head and my heart had become so accelerated, that I always waited him to be able to cum."
"This time, he made me cum in a way that my body was shaking."
"After 6 hours of pleasure, we left the motel."
But was still in ecstasy.
"I met a friend of my sister recently, he's 17 years old and from what I understand, he is very player, then I decided ""study"" his type and I'll give some advices for the passionate little girls who read this."
Today will be the day that he will be completely and madly in love with you if everything has gone well.
"All the love in the world for him, without falling in temptation."
"Today I'm very upset, I think I am being cheated on, my husband is treating me differently with the biggest coldness."
"I had already cheated on me another time and I forgiven, he is acting just like the other time, treating me with the biggest coldness"
I talked with my ex.
"We only know about the things living, many judge."
"Only who really knows, is me who is living, feeling."
"He said that he doesn't want to split up, doesn't want to see me alone."
"He said that he truly likes me, and asked me to have pacience."
I'm only supposed to separate when he separates.
"All I want more than anything is for it to work out with my husband, live a intense love with him."
"Pronounce that I admire you, that I like you is too little."
"Because our friendship derseves more than words, deserved to be told to the world, so that everyone could feel, and maybe even understand the meaning of our friendship."
"But recently, I can't take it, it's like if I need something more, you know, or better, I need, need you."
"What I am feeling for you is something that not even me can explain, I tried to get involved with many, tried to forget you of many ways, but I can't, it's stronger than me."
"Not even a kiss from you I could, but I can affirm that wasn't necessary to me for fall in love for you."
"I wish I could forget the light in your eyes, because then I wouldn't miss them, I wish I could forget the tone of your voice, the way you speak, I wish I could forget that beautiful smile that only you have."
"I really wanted, but I can't, because what I feel for you is so strong, impossible to forget."
"But one thing is sure, I love a lot and even I wanting to forget you, I love you each more, today more than yesterday, tomorrow more than ever."
"To be without you is to have a sense of time and not know how to fill it, is lose the peace and meet the absence of someone present."
"Wait is painful, forget is painful, but don't know what to do is the worst kind of suffering."
"I've waited so much to get to this point, I don't know what more to do, I am afraid of losing your friendship, or rather, I believe I have, because you don't even want to accept me anymore."
"But, the affraid of you distance yourself from me is behher than everything."
Pay attention to the music I listen to and the things I post.
"In the way I treat you, in how I care about you."
"I really needed say that to you, I couldn't take anymore."
"When the night comes, sleeping time, I lay my head on the pillow and my thoughts transport me to a wonderful world."
"I think I am in your arms, shrunk and shy, in love and realised."
I feel the force and the harm of the one that is the man of my life.
"I dream about you the whole night and I feel myself afflicted and insecure for not knowing if some day, I will transform that dream in reality."
Don't be amazed with that confusion.
It's really a wild love declaration.
I don't want this disturb you and take out your peace.
"In the opposite, I would like to always be in your side to love you and give you a lot of affection."
I want all the tranquility for you.
"Think about this, know that I love you very much, I really wish your company."
I want to give you all my love.
Cover you with kisses and satiate all your desires.
"That is all had the courage to dream, in the hope of someday see this my pretension realized."
"Now you should know why I don't stand your little girlfriends, because they were all with the boy that I really love and wanna be with and always wanted."
"It may be that what I said doesn't make the slightest bit of difference, because you started a new relationship recently, but I needed to express anyway."
"And I hope that you understand me, because I didn't ask to fall in love, because who bosses us is the heart."
"Sincerely, the love doesn't choose, just happens."
"Things happen in the worst moments, it's part of that long travel called life."
"I woke up like usual at 6:20 to go to school, dressed up, and went."
"Arriving there, I talked to my friends and went to the corridor, where I wait my boyfriend everyday until 7:20, then he arrived, stashed the material and came to talk to me."
"He got close of me, gave me that hug and said: 'I love you.'."
"Asked if I was better (recently I was just crying), said to him that I was normal, but I can't trick him, he knew that I wasn't okay."
"I walked into my classroom, then, with my eyes full of tears, I had to restrain myself, because the girls who say be my friends would only want to know why I was crying and would criticize me."
"Then, I spent 3 classes holding myself to not cry and trying to study, because I was going to take 3 exams during the break."
"Then, after these three hours, the break arrived, I met my boyfriend again, we went down together and we went to the courtyard to sit as usual in the same place we sit everyday."
"I was dying to cry, so I held the tears and said to him that I could look to him, that if I looked, my eye would start to tear up."
"It was complicated, because I couldn't concentrate on anything else, what I most wanted was ending these exams and go home to cry everything I held."
"Finishing the exam, I went down, found him on the courtyard, he took the book from my hand and went to the stop, arriving there we sat down and started to talk, conversation came and went."
"I confess that I was very upset by this, because I've never stopped remembering him in these 10 months of dating, I've always gave thing to him on celebration days, arriving home, I cryed a lot."
"My boyfriend and I then, we had a disagreement over the phone and I started to cry."
"I love him so much and never want to lose him, because he is the reason of my smiles, of my happiness!"
"We always say we won't, but we fall in love for the wrong people, but without realizing it, we are already enchanted by the person without even knowing him."
"Giving ourselves away too much, beliving and we always suffer with this."
"We give away our heart, the pride and all our love."
"And how many times have we cried for the person who doesn't deserve a drop of our tears, we run after him and don't see the truth, and many times we don't want to see it, because the truth hurts and hurts a lot."
"And when I find that person that is all special, makes you smile, forget about yor past and makes you think about the present, we don't stop thinking about about him, spend hours obsessed on him, we learn to like what he likes and do what he does just to say that we have a lot in common."
"And when you wake up, already rise with him in your head, thinking 'How I miss him', and dreaming high, putting the person in our life."
"Many times, this person hurts our feelings without knowing what we feel."
"The worst is when we get attached to that person and he leave, without knowing that the one left is each more in love, that can't imagine her life without him, and we say 'life goes on', but part of us is taken with the persons who left."
"Our heart is always the victim, is always left in pieces."
It races when the person comes close and beats harder because already thinks that is his other half.
"And when that person comes close, we start to shake, the hand sweats, the hearts accelerates, our world becomes different, because that person is very special."
"I would like to get something off one’s chest with you, my history with my family."
"My mom was a single mother, I didn't have a father."
She had 5 children and no one had a father.
"She was always considered by the relatives a nothing, had no money, was sick and very unhappy."
"When I was 3 years old, I went to live in an aunt's house, because my mother didn't have condition to raise me."
"This aunt, even though she gave me everything she was a demon, she yelled at me, let the other relatives mistreat me and beat me, grounded me in places where was really scared, in conclusion, she was and is a fake, disgusting and bad witch."
"After I came back to my mother's home at age 13, my older sister was in a life of drugs and wrong things, she always beat me, weore my clothes and left the dirty, lent to her drugged friends, teased me in such a way that I felt like getting the hell out of there."
"When I thought that I would have peace, my older brothers were more agressives, they beat me for anything, beat no, spanked me, one my brother kicked my belly, that I kept menstruating for almost ten days."
"I remember that I used to eat a lot at school, so I wouldn't have to eat at home, and took bath hidden, it was very sad."
"Until at the age of 15, I practically ran away from home and until today, at the 20, I didn't come back."
"I got the help of a person to rent a house, buy furniture, be doing college and have a more and less life."
"However, nowadays that I have a financial condition better than my family, they try to take the little that I have."
"My mom only calls me to ask me the things, she is not capable to visit me, to be present in my life, when she come to my place or he keeps complaining about life so that I will be moved and give her money."
"My younger sister, she sucks, I was trying to help her paying her college and she was never able to treat me with love and respect; quite the opposite, in front of my aunt who raised me, she wouldn't even greet me."
"I am so angry to think that from the time I left their house, I keep helping them, especially my mom and I've never received love in return, something I couldn't stand the loneliness."
"They don't like me, don't belive in my potential to become a psychologist, they don't give anything for me, to them I'm the same thing as a rat."
"God will put a good person in my life, that will give all the love I need and when I graduate, my family, I will have, the support I never had."
"I respect a lot the animals, I learned that we shouldn't mistreat neither of the animals."
After she hugged me and said that all of us have our life time and that nobody can know yours.
"But miracles exist, I asked her."
"The miracles exist because didn't reconstructed Hiroshima from the tears, from blood, from loneliness, now is a busy port, she said to me."
"When I told to the mom, she got scared, affraid of what I would think and wanted to know who told me and I said that was daddy."
Said to him that I had nothing to forgive.
Mom was so proud of me and said that I am a angel.
I decided to act as natural as possible.
But it's inevitable realise the sadness in their eyes.
"I heard dad and mom talking yesterday in the room, they said that all medical resources would be at my disposal at whatever price."
I love them a lot because they are taking care of me very well.
"While this is not happening, I live my sweet life."
"And I got tired of worrying about others, wanting always the good from people around me, and get the name of boring."
"Being nice even to those who I should be boring, try treating everyone well."
"Two brothers that lived on neighboring farms, splited only by a stream, entered in conflict."
"What started with a little misunderstanding, finally exploded in an exchange of harsh words, followed by weeks of total silence."
"On a morning, the older brother heard a knock at his door."
"I'm looking for work, maybe you have a service to me."
"I think I understand the situation, show me where are the shovel and the nails."
The older brother delivered the material and went to the city.
"The man stood there cutting, measuring, working all day."
"Instead of fence, a bridge was constructed there, connecting the two banks of the stream."
It was a beautiful work.
"After look again to the bridge, he saw his brother getting close with the arms open."
"You were really a good friend bulding this bridge even after what I said to you, suddenly, in one impulse, the older brother ran towards the other and they hugged each other."
"The carpenter that made the work, left with his toolbox."
"Have you ever thought how much easier things would be if we stopped building fences and walls and started to build bridges with our family, friends, co-workers, and most of all our enemies."
"It's really good love, and be loved is even better."
"I don't feel that love anymore, I don't feel pleasure, I cant' even like me."
"Sometimes I think in pray, in talk to God."
I have many sins that I would have to be born twice to ask forgiveness to God and regret all of them.
"Even so, I keep making the same mistakes, like something was pulling me, to the bottom of the well, to a dead end, I miss affection, getting dressed, going out, having friends to talk, I miss being someone, to be remembered, to be loved, I feel lost."
"The beauty of a woman is in her smile, in her personality, in her simplicity."
The beauty of a woman is inside of her.
"I have pride of myself, even with all my faults, problems and obsessions, I am satisfied with myself."
"I'm strong, mature, and learn with my mistakes."
"That's right, I'm proud of myself, because even with all the problems, I'm still here intact."
I'm in love to my best friend.
"I only know that now I'm better, and you know what more surprised me, the fact of these words come from her."
It was God using the mouth of a friend of mine to transmit the message to me about he having something better for me.
"Thank you for showing me through Leticia that he wasn't the guy for me, that in the future, something better waits for me."
"I was already receiving several signals that it was not him,but I didn't notice, and only now after this, I stopped to look around and saw that he is not my guy."
"I found someone that really makes me happy, maybe, God wants him to be only my friend, my best friend, that friend from kindergarten, God has something better to me."
"Passionate about the simple things the world offers like the forest, the rain, the sun, the moon, the dew of the forest."
"I'm like a river that runs in search of something, but doesn't know what, and not even when it will arrive."
"I'm always available to help my friends, my real friends and who needs."
"It was the most beautiful thing, the graduation of my goddaughter."
"Congratulations, Camilly Vitória, went to elementary school, I really love you goddaughter."
"Quando durmo a noite sempre sonho com você, você é lindo."
"Despite the distance, there is still a hope that I can see you, my eternal love."
But it's only you that makes me feel good.
"I don't care about that, I only care about you."
"Please explain me, I've never imagined be able to love like this."
"Last year, I met a boy, hooked up him him."
"The only one that knows the answer is HIM, so, reflect on your life ans ask forgiveness for your sins, as the Bible itself teaches, don't judge the next one, to not be judged."
"I have some plans in my mind, and there is a deadline for them to be realized."
"I ask God to give me patience, because everything is a phase."
"I'm the only man that will always be loyal to you, the one that will never abandon you."
"I do miracles, you don't know, but I'm planning your future, and the plans that I have for you, will make you very happy."
"I put it in your life, for you learn what it is to love, and know how to value the true love, when it comes."
Because I made your soul mate.

"I made the world, I made the love."
"And before you was born, I had already written your history."

"I have always been very strict about my mastubation life, let's agree, touch yourself is wonderful, but nobody goes around telling and have never talked about this subject with a friend."
"Just like that, I was smiling at life, without wanting something serious and he was conquering me little by little with a nice conversation."
"He was always proposing about hotter webcam and I was once wearing only bra and panties, but this was a lot of months late."
"Not to mention that our messages went through the wee hours of the morning and always ended on the same subject, sex."
"He would tell me: 'I'm sure we will never do these things that we talk, but okay.'."
"I meet him every Satyrday, he lives two or three blocks away from my condo and we have mutual friends."
"Well, anyway, we always arranged a basic movie theater."
"But, it was in a week, very well planned by me, that finally occurred our dream date."
"I told my mother that I was going to have ice cream with some imaginary friends, the ice cream store is next to his house and a little far from mine, in the initial contract, he had proposed having ice cream and the second part I had to choose."
"Arriving at his home, I felt myself confortable."
He and I were studying a subject from his course.
"We started to kiss, he said sweet things."
"Then, he started trying to play with my privates, trying on top of my shorts."
"He played, something that hurt a little, because of the thick finger, but it was good."
We kissed more and he took me until the corner of my condo.
I came back to be happy and I'm laughing about evrything that happened.
"I would like to be an expert in life, to understand my heart."
"Because it is with him that I breathe, that I dream, and is on it that I keep my joys."
"Who loves doesn't forget, who loves doesn't let go."
He confides in me that you were the mouth he most enjoyed kissing.
"Well, as my last post was on August, since then many things have happened and this whole time without posting something was because my days were very busy, I'll try to keep a certain frequency around here."
"In the month of September there was nothing interesting, worked a lot as usual and very close to the end of the year."
These last 3 months is the time that we work more because we earn on commission.
"It means that I already knew her by sight, we spoke just for an 'Hi'."
"Then, the time passed and she walked in front of the store that I work and we see each other."
"Until this month of October, she sent me an invitation on Facebook and I added her."
"The, my friend, came to talk that she said that I was handsome ans asked me if I had a girlfriend."
"I felt firmness in her side, saw interest, this cheered me up."
"I little shy, she came give me a hug and two kisses in my face."
"Right that time, I felt that warm body, a good sensation and she was very pretty."
"We spent 20 minutes talking before the film and the conversation was good, she was smiling, touching me, adjusting her blouse and hair, signs of her interest."
"Something hot, really hot was kissing for the first time and was really good for me."
"My desire was to grab her breasts, her thigh, kiss her whole body, I was really horny."
"She told me that I was a very special guy, that I knew how to treat a woman like a queen."
But at some point I will have to learn living with this.
"Because only thing is sure, if it is not to be with you, will be with someone that loves me and gives back."
"Today is my first day here, I'm loving!"
I fell in love with a boy who is from this site.
"And that's how we met and became friends and we really were friends without interest in anything, only friends."
"We spent seven days together and lived a beautiful love story, like in a movie, I still remember our first kiss in front of the sea, we even wrote our names in the trailer that was abandoned on the road."
"We were together for 4 years and I loved him more than everything, he was the first in my life for everything, I did nothing without him and we were always together."
"After that day, I changed, innovated my look, changed my closet, finished the studies, today I'm a psychologist and help a lot of women like me, if I tell you that I forgot, it wouldn't be true, but I can remember everything without pain."
"I met a new love, we have been together for 3 years and didn't live a beautful movie story, but we love  and respect each other, we gave up a lot to make this work, but we respect our limits and grow together, we are getting married in December."
"My mother advised me that one day, when I had a great love, I should fight for it and that what I did."
"Don't let your life pass you by, write your story day by day, you deserve be happy, you have to be happy, don't give others powers they don't have."
"I know very well that I will be writing and he will be watching, analyzing what I'm doing."
"The other times I came to write, it was to tell funny stories."
"But as everything has its positive side, I belive that this experience will be useful for my next relationships."
"I'm here posting this, I don't even know what it's for, but let's go, right?"
"I woke up with Matheus calling me, after this I made something, my mom arrived, I came to the computer, already went to Dani's house and that's it."
Life gives so many turns.
"Today, I woke up thinking, that it was going to be just another day."
"But I also have a huge joy, I made a new friend, someone who seemed to me to be very special and has a lot to teach me."
We had already been dating for 2 months.
"It was his birthday, and I wanted to do something different."
"Me, a friend and his family, what a wonderful family, all playful, united, lovable."
"Between laughs, jokes, was very nice."
"He took me to his room, and there was really good."
"It feels like it happened yesterday, because I can even feel his smell."
"We started with one of that kiss, super engaging."
"Between kisses, she started to caress me, I was already ready to do it, and between kisses I got completely involved."
"He caressed me with so much desire, so horny."
"After penetrating me was intense, was pleasurable."
"Was wonderful, I felt his grip while having sex, it was much more hot."
"Our union gave birth to a beautiful little girl, that is my life and today is 4 years old."
"We didn't hook up, not even kissed, we had lunch together a few times, talked by phone to each other and we corresponded by messages and MSN, it all started with a friendship."
"I spent the whole weekend making a video to my boyfriend for this day, apart from the new underwear set that I bought for today."
Sometimes I have the sensation that the animals are slightly more endowed with intelligence than us humans.
All of us have the duty to contemplate the light that exist in each one.
"I'm happy about that, because we were made to shine."
"We are stars, we are our own lights."
"I keep thinking, how it will be when I start college, get married, have kids."
But the sensation of someone close was enough to me.
"My life is full of happiness and sadness, but I love live my life."
I went to my boyfriend's house today and he had gone to the market.
"Therefore, I ask that he be very happy wherever he goes, he will be prosperous there."
"An old Sioux Indian legend tells, that once, Touro Bravo, the most brave and honorable of all young warriors, and Nuvem Azul, the cacique's daughter, one of the most beautiful woman of the tribe, arrived holding hands, until the tent of the old tribal wizard."
"We love each other, and we're getting married."
"And the old man was thrilled to see them so young, so in love and so anxious for a word."
"The youths hugged each other tenderly, and soon left to fulfill the recommended mission."
"On the established day, in front of the wizard's tent, the two were waiting with the birds in a bag."
The old man asked them to carefully take them out of the bags and saw that they were actually beautiful specimens.
"I thought that the best way to express myself, tell my wins and losses, the risght and wrong things that I made made, it had to be on computer."
"I keep thinking I need to go to a psychologist, because he sure is the one I can trust because he keeps it all with him to have an income."
The love that I feel to you is unconditional.

"Loved me everytime I most needed, always supported me."
"Luckily HE (boyfriend) called me, the time passed really fast, we talked a lot, we are good now."

"I kept watching him teaching, dreaming, imagining things."
He brought up the subject with me and stopped calling me by my name and started to call me by my nickname.
He was really sweet with me on MSN and that flamed even more this platonic love on me.
"I just didn't try anything with it, because he is engaged."
Platonic love that fills my soul.

Passion is only a moment thing and like is different than love.
I entered in this forum and saw nice and intelligent people.
"While you are important to people, you are beautiful, is cute, is intelligent, is sexy and if you go beyond everything you become the love."

"It all started like this, I went to visit a friend of mine that called me earlier saying that she wanted to see me, but, arriving in front of her house, I saw that was everything closed, in other words, either she wasn't at home or was already sleeping."
"That's when I found a woman that I had already met before and stopped in the car, looks like an American movie, where the handsome guy stop and the woman gets in the car and it was really like this."
"We had hooked up before and was really crazy, she had already sucked me until I cum in her mouth."
I stopped in the parking lot of a market in the Santo Antonio neighborhood in Manaus and there we started tto hold each other tightly.
She immediately ran to my legs and started to touch my penis with much mastery.
I said that I wanted to kill the miss and she said that she also wanted.
This was the report about my New Year sex.

"As soon as I arrived, Penélope was waiting."
We left the waiting room and I entered in a long hallway.
We arrived at our little corner: a gurney surrounded by curtains.
"And, then, Penélope passed the first hot wax layer in my virgin groin."
"Good, warm, pleasant."
I woke up in the ilusion of going to a party and drink like every 17 year old teenager.

The movie teach us how to love and respect the person you love.
I saw and fell in love even more with my husband and my marriage.
The true friends are angels!
I discovered this irrefutable truth by realizing how rare these precious things are that suddenly arrive in our lives and lodge slowly in a special and essential place in our existence.
"Over the years, we find several types of angels."
"Some are light and funny, they show us the joy of life."
"Some bump into us on some street corner, without warning and give us real affections, real smiles, real protection."
"The important thing is to try, throughout our lives, having always some angel that we can count on in difficult times to give us encouragement."
I have noticed how my life has changed from some years to now and how I changed.
I'm selective about my friendships.
Everything that is different bothers the same.
"Today I got a scapular from my mother, and it has a message from God in one of the little squares."
"Nowadays, I'm in a homosexual relationship."
"Today, I started the day talking with Gabriel, the newest one here at the new construction where I am one of the responsible people."
"But he is handsome, that smile, the way he talks to me is very sweet."
"I sent an e-mail to my ""colleague"" last Wednesday, saying that if he was available I was needing to talk."
"I don't want to be judged, curse me or something like that, I just want you to understand me!"
