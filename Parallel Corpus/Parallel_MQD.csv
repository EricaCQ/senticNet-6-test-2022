Hi dear diary, once again I'm sitting here feeling like shit and it's all my fault!
It's amazing to realize that we are coming together each day more and more.
In life we ​​need to count on the support of the person we have chosen to share all our moments.
I'm very happy and I hope you are too.
We ordered a pizza to celebrate, and I wrote a letter and left it on his side of the bed!
We have the basic ingredient that sustains everything and that only a few are privileged to have: Love.
A toast to our existence, and to our future.
Today a war comes to an end.
A battle is not over, the war will continue, the war is about destroying the chains that separate me from my aspirations and from my dreams.
I’m very skinny and tall, I’m not in shape and I suffer because of it.
By the way, I'm already 13 years old and I ALMOST don't have a body, the girls in my class are full developed, and here I am with thin thighs.
Imagine a tall 14 year old girl tall, no boobs, no booty, with long and thin thighs, she surely would look like shit.
I'm already a young lady, I notice when boys look at girls with big boobs and big asses, almost nobody notices me, and this is very annoying.
When everything seems to fall apart inside me, I feel myself falling to pieces.
All I wish is to be alone, turn off the bedroom light and wait for time to pass, hoping the pain will go away.
Time always helps but sometimes 1 minute alone in that dark room seems like too much time.
I feel weak to fight for all the things I want, and people are always letting us down.
Trusting yourself is the best solution to avoid those situations.
Trying to be strong and believe that everything will pass.
I love the way you look at me so tenderly, like everything about me is new.
I love your sincerity and innocence.
You make me feel good and I feel like I am truly loved.
I can no longer stand to hear his insults and jokes, throwing things he did for me in my face, and that's why I decided to be a call girl.
I wrote this report at the behest of my son's father.
He insisted that I reported our romance exactly, from the beginning, omitting nothing, and then published it on the Internet.
I am married and I am happy with my marriage, I have a good job where I met someone.
Do you know that feeling when you identify with a person right away, have lunch with them every day and end up becoming friends?
As we had lunch together almost every day, we ended up getting to know each other well, I knew about his girlfriends and he knew a little about me.
I started taking rides with him after the office hours, in a matter of fact, I thought it would be better to hide this information from my husband, he thinks I come back by bus, but buses are so crowded and take a long ride.
One day, the traffic was horrible because of the floods, and he suggested we should stop in a small street to take a break, luckily the car has tinted windows giving us more safety.
He was talking facing me with his hand on the back of my sit and, strangely, I started to feel good being around him.
I began to feel a strange internal arousal, not exactly for him, but for the situation.
After all, for me, who had always lived the life of a faithful wife, everything was new, and new things always attract women.
He lowered his hand to my neck, I could feel his breath.
I shivered, he noticed and came closer and closer, he held my face, He brought his face closer until he pressed his lips to mine.
I did not know what to do!
I was surprised and paralyzed!
I felt like a shock and heat all over my body at this unusual situation.
I was already breathing fast
We ended up kissing more and more, my arms hugging him.
I confess it gave me an almost unknown pleasure, it was a delight to feel our tongues touching each other while he squeezed my breasts.
He insinuated that I could be pregnant, I said it wasn’t possible, because I was on contraceptives.
I wished things were different so badly, but unfortunately the Lord changed the course of our lives forever.
You haven't left anything for my future, you forgot about me as if I had I never existed.
But that's ok, now I realized that I never needed you for anything because even when I missed you and I cried.
I wasn’t missing you anymore I stopped crying for you because my mother's love filled me and drained away all my pain.
We must never forget that we are the architects of our own destiny, each of us has our own free will to live our lives the way we want.
I hope you are very happy, and wish you a peaceful old age, that you are healthy enough to take care of your children, they need you.
I can't bear to hold this by myself anymore.
It is really sad to know that I my sister made me date a gay boy just to hide his relationship with my 15-year-old nephew.
It is even sadder to know that she pressured me to lose my virginity to him, supported my relationship, let me get so involved until I fell strongly in love with him.
I'm tired of fighting with my mother, that she is never on my side.
Worst of all, he broke up with me, claiming that I couldn't stay outside until 4 am
The moon is so beautiful tonight, so perfect, a masterpiece of God.
I always liked to gaze at the sky, to look at the stars, to understand the mystery that is up there and when I look at the moon, ah moon!
She reminds me of so many beautiful things, it's as if she were an accomplice of lovers, of those in love and sometimes I gaze at her and I feel a very good peace.
Thank you God for doing all this for me.
I love you so much my Father!
My boyfriend has no style at all, could you help me?
Guys, I'm always well-groomed, smelling nice, wearing makeup when I’m with my boyfriend, I've never made him feel ashamed anywhere.
People even look and don't believe we’re a couple.
Today I was going to work in a flowered strapless, wearing very high heels, a lace vest, makeup according to the outfit, pearl earring and a rayban
And my boyfriend was wearing shorts, a polo shirt, and oakley sneakers, his left shoe has no laces, all torn, dirty.
It's disgusting, then I took the company bus and when I got on it, he took one arm off his shirt, you know, and then he was going to take off the rest of it.
What a shame I had on that bus, he looked like a total chav.
I bought him a red v-neck zip-up shirt.
Today is my birthday.
The day already started badly.
My mother didn’t remember it, very few people remembered it.
And my father surely won’t remember.
I don't know, each day I just wish less and less to be here.
"Last year everything was just ""perfect"" and this year, not at all."
The one I most hoped to remember it, just didn't.
I just want this day to be over soon.
I got home from school yesterday, I had lunch and I had the headphones on the last volume.
My 4 year old cousin was in the living room talking to my mom so I just finished it and went to the living room.
It's so hard for her to love me, because she says I'm not going to make a difference, the only thing I wanted was to be my mother's friend, but she resists me.
I don't believe I will pass to ITB, or even to FIEB.
In ITB I think I got about 35 out of 50.
I've never regretted something so much, I doubt I'll pass with these scores, passing to Buildings requires 40 points or more.
I certainly won't be one of the 24 people with the most correct answers!
I’ll die in shame when the result comes out!
Everyone keeps saying I have passed, but they don't realize that I’ve chosen the most popular course!
I’m feeling really bad, I should have listened to my math teacher and chosen some random course.
I have even less chances at FIEB.
Everyone keeps saying I'm going to pass but I know I won't.
The answers will be released on Wednesday night, then I'll know how many I got right.
And on the 22nd at night the list of those who were selected comes out, then, if there’s still any, a list of remaining vacancies will be released.
But I don't think I'll be in the remaining ones either.
There were a lot of people, I'm sure that the 24 who enter have aced the test!
But that's not why he feels the need to live by announcing his qualities.
He prefers discretion, keeping quiet, observing and coming to his own conclusions.
He cares very little about the opinion of others.
He is very sexy and knows how to explore it very well.
He tends to be jealous and possessive, which is a big fault.
It would be good to be careful with certain habits.
Today I thought a lot about everything you said to me.
My insomnia reached a critical level and I’ve finally decided to go to the psychiatrist to check what he could do.
I went there determined I would only leave with some other medicine besides the antidepressant.
He prescribed me zolpidem, a hypnotic, to help me sleep.
Despite being a red label, I won't be able to use it for more than two months, because of addiction.
I spent a long time thinking about whether to take it or not, as if it were a poison or something.
Me and my fear of taking new meds, afraid of giving myself a side reaction or something like that.
But it was ok. I lay down and slept like a baby, both times I took it.
And when I wake up, I don't spend the day sluggish.
I wake up in a much better mood.
Im in love with the medicine so far.
Last week I had sex with my boyfriend at his house.
He, as I predicted, didn't have a condom, and I refused to have sex like that.
Then he said we'd do it another day.
I insisted and went to buy the condom at the pharmacy myself.
I was a little embarrassed, but it was worth it.
We have our little fights every now and then, but I love him.
I don’t know, it's a strange relationship.
I change my feelings towards him a lot.
When we fight, sometimes it seems like I don't feel anything for him
But sometimes it feels like I'm going to explode with so much love.
And he notices it, how cold I get at the slightest little fight.
As for the symptoms of OCD, they're still pretty annoying.
The thought 'I want to kill myself' appears very often.
And I've even been hurting myself lightly again, although I have never really stopped, strictly speaking.
I scream dozens of times during the day.
The compulsion for sweets continues, it gives me a momentary relief.
I even thought about sniffing glue, in fact it was something more symbolic of my despair, I knew it wouldn't do any good.
It was one of those styrofoam glues, and it was already dry.
But despite all these things, sometimes I forget everything I'm going through and I feel so good.
The antidepressant has its share of contribution, but it is not just the medicine.
I don't think my life is a disgrace, despite OCD, low self-esteem, anxiety, insomnia, panic, family problems.
And by the way, next Monday my college classes start.
The subjects are boring, but at least the workload is smaller.
Most classes are in the morning, so I have to wake up early.
On the one hand it will be good because I won't have to listen to my mother screaming in traffic, which helps a lot.
Today, about to turn 30, I decided to put an end to my fat and boost my self-esteem.
I am 1.57 cm tall and 60 kg.
I'm already at the limit to be above weight.
Hi Dear Diary, I've been missing you, I haven't written much because my vacations were so boring and I didn’t have much to write about it, but now classes have started and I'm going to write again!
Well, my first day of school has already started with two new teachers.
In the first period, Ricardo, with mathematics and geometry, and in the second period, Kairton, with grammar, interpretation and writing.
In Ricardo's class we reviewed some things from last year and he gave me some homework, I liked him, he's funny!
In Kairton's class we also made a review but the part I liked the most was when we evaluated the song.
We went to evaluate the song that was that song by Legião Urbana, Pais e Filhos, we really love this song.
I listen it all and I was so proud of myself!
And wow, he already memorized my name, that annoying Aline was full of envy, I like the new teachers, especially Kairton.
No, now you're great!
Well, I saw him and he saw me, but he didn't speak to me.
I'm not going to talk about the tragedy of Santa Maria, because just thinking about it makes me want to cry, well I'll finish it now, after school I'll tell you more!
I always seem to take the more complicated path, I'm tired of everything being so dramatic.
My world, my dramas.
Seeing you leaving could have been one more, but that's not what's happening.
I think about you all the time, and my heart aches thinking about what you're doing.
All the moments I waste with you.
I feel weak and suffocated by my own heart.
I think he prefers you, not my reason.
Without you I feel without wings, unable to fly.
A friend of mine was already aware that I liked my friend.
Today, on holiday’s eve, she coincidentally was in the same group as him, and decided to ask him if he liked me, but he said he liked me only as a friend.
But then she started saying that I liked him and finally, she complimented the green eyes.
That boy isn’t full of himself, he's super nice, but I fell in love with him a while ago.
He will probably talk to me on facebook.
I wonder, will he start analyzing me?
I won't care if he says he only wants me as a friend, that's fine, but I just don't want him to treat me worse.
Specially because everything that's been happening lately is taking me closer to him.
Guys I'm 13 and I've never kissed in my entire LIFE.
And the worst of all is that I've never been used to talk to boys, and I don't consider myself a very pretty person either.
I was a very shy child, I remember that the whole class made a mess while I just stood on the corner, alone without talking to anyone.
It was always very difficult for me to fit in with people.
The miserable life of Paulo Anderson.
I've been through so much sadness and disappointment in this life, right? I'm glad I write just for myself, because I am the only one who knows everything I've been through, I never wanted to share my shitty life with anyone.
My life is an internal and eternal suffering.
I've never been hungry or sick, I thank God for having my two eyes,
I took refuge in umbanda with my guides and guides of others.
There were so many difficulties, so many mysteries, so many unexplained questions.
I've lost count of how many ways I've tried to find out the truth.
Wrong yards, wrong guides, lack of education with people, responsibility, lack of attitude, lack of luck, lack of leaving home, not pursuing goals, too many handjob, cards, tarot, opening work
I thought abou many reasons for my suffering, and until today I had not found the answer!
Now I am 21 years old, as if by the help of the Heaven above, and this week I began to read reports of people who were healed through past life therapy.
symptoms that I've always suffered from, such as shyness, depression, isolation, misguided mediumship, fights with families, lack of affection and professional life, I tried to look for some form of self-regression but I couldn't find them.
So I decided to Google clinics that offered past life therapy in Goiânia, until then I didn't even know it existed here, I had only seen it on television.
I found Crisanne Braga's blog, a great holistic therapist that lives here in the city, I read some articles on her blog and got in touch with her wanting to know the prices.
Today was my first session, the therapist made a good impression on me.
We talked and soon I felt comfortable with her, I thought I wouldn't have the courage to tell my problems to a stranger, but I managed to talk about everything with her.
During a moment of relaxation and laughter, I had a very strange moment, I felt a spirit close to me and suddenly I had a feeling that I had been in that clinic before.
EVERY TIME MY BROTHER-IN-LAW COMES HOME HE FINDS A WAY TO BE ALONE WITH ME.
TODAY IT'S RAINING AND I STAYED IN BED, THEN HE ARRIVED SMOOTHLY AND SAT NEXT TO ME, SO FAR SO GOOD.
BUT HE STARTED TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE TV TO LOOK AT ME, I PRETENDED I DIDN'T NOTICE AND KEPT FOCUSED ON THE TV.
THEN  HE PUT HIS HAND UNDER THE BLANKET TRYING TO TOUCH ME.
OF COURSE I DIDN'T ALLOW IT... THE RAGE…, WILL MY SISTER EVER REALIZE HE'S NO GOOD.
THEN I GOT UP AND WENT OUTSIDE, BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG AND HE CAME AFTER ME, ASKING ME WHAT TIME I LEAVE WORK.
I SAID I WORKED UNTIL LATE.
AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S TRIES SOMETHING… I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO DETAILS
I HOPE HE STAYS FAR AWAY FROM ME..... SPECIALLY BECAUSE HE'S NOT HANDSOME AT ALL.
Well, first of all I must express here that she sent me the email below, telling me everything in details and I guarantee it is 100% true.
Arriving at the factory, I did the normal process, when I entered my office, the phone rang and I saw his name appear on the phone’s display, my heart raced I answered and we made an appointment to see each other when we leave work, I'm kind of calm.
At lunchtime, he calls me and says he is very horny wow, my body heats up, as something kicks in me with the sound of his voice,
I confirmed and waited for the time.
The  bus stopped and asked if I would go to Benq, I said no.
They left, I entered the office, he was in front of the computer, when I put the purse and a bag that was on a table next to him, he kissed me lustful, wishing more, we started the preliminaries right there.
We left the factory and went to a nearby place with few stars, but viable, arriving at the room, with a not nice  stand, but as we were already willing for each other we started, but I asked to clean myself, because I handle tools with oil, grease, etc.
I feel very dirty, so I went in the shower, wet my body, ran my hand over the soap that was on my table, I had bought it to meet his mother.
I'm here to share my sad life, more specifically my sad life as a cocaine addict.
It's been more than 5 years that I've suffered from this disease, I've lost a lot and I'm losing more every day, today was one of those days when I thought about suicide, but again I decided to keep trying.
I'm alone despite being married, but for some time this marriage has been nothing more than a piece of paper, love has gone along with respect and trust, all that's left is self-indulgence, sadness and hopelessness due to lack of my wife.
I've done and suffered things that make me feel like crap, I've been through situations that you wouldn’t wish even to your worst enemy, today I won't give details, but over time I'll talk about it.
I'm alone, my wife spent the day out and said she was at her mother's house, I say she said because I fear I've been cheated for some time.
I've already hurt my wife in so many ways that I don't even have the courage to call her, even though I think she might be in a motel with someone.
I don't have the courage to demand her loyalty and that is a greatest shame for a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a person, I'm nothing with drugs.
I'm here, feeling the taste of the drug that still drips down my nose, I'm depressed, on the edge of despair and with immense sadness.
I know that the excessive sadness is due to the effects of the drug, I know that this chemical sadness will pass, but I will still carry the real sadness for the life, this one follows me every day.
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do, I'm lost, I even asked my dog ​​to help me, in a psychotic hope that he would respond, or do something magical.
I just don't have anyone to turn to, I don't have a mother or family because my mother and I had some disagreements, she was always violent and sick.
She always lost control and used demonic malice while beating me.
My father was never a real father figure, overshadowed by my mother's strength
My sister, I have nothing to do with her, she doesn't even exist for me, my brother, I feel sorry for him, but he lives well despite everything.
It's midnight now, I'm going to bing-watch a series and delude myself with the hope of happy endings that always exist in it, and hope that one day I have a happy ending of my own.
It is 00:03 now, I am depressed, alone and uncertain of my future.
But I keep fighting, I've been fighting since the day I gave up trying to kill myself by jumping off a slab onto a bamboo tree at two o'clock in the morning of a starry night.
Well, this is my first text so I'll introduce myself, my name is Kevin, I live in PE.
Since last night, my mom won't even look me in the face or talk to me.
Today I woke up and she didn't even look at me.
She is used to tell me things and later she lies to my face that she haven't said anything about it
Last week I did her hair, because I take a hairdressing course and I have to practice it, but of course I know how to perfectly blow-dry a hair straight and use a flat iron.
So I did her hair, I blew-dry it from the outside to match her cut, then she came back saying it was horrible and told me to do it all over again, but from inside out.
Last week, she asked me to do her hair again, so I did it, outside and stuff.
Then she came back saying that it was horrible, that I didn't know how to do anything right, that my course was worthless and that other people do it better than me.
That hurt me, man, imagine, it would hurt anyone, right?
And today, my mother, my father and I were in the living room, then my mother said that I never did anything for her, I was never willing to share opinions about her hair and such.
Then I told my father what she had told me that day, she said it was a lie, that I was a liar and she didn't say any of that.
Man, really, it makes me mad at her.
Why does she lie like that?
And it wasn't the first time, she always lies.
She tells me things and then says she didn't, she calls me a liar.
I like her a lot and I know she loves me.
My grandmother passed away, I am not dealing well with this situation.
I'm afraid of falling into depression again, my heart has an immense void, I try to do everything to occupy my head, pass my time and nothing consoles me, nothing makes me get the image of her last breath out of my head.
I love you grandma, keep taking care of me wherever you are, thank you for the wonderful grandma you were for me, for every gesture of affection and smile.
You were, are, and always will be my warrior, you didn't lose to cancer, but cancer lost to you, my warrior.
You still played, you made us smile and whenever someone said, how are you, Dona Maria?
You always replied, I'm fine thank God, what a warrior woman you were, grandma, I love you so much.
This longing is such an an immense pain, every day when I wake up I pick up the phone wanting to call you to check how you are, I think I haven't been able to discern all of this yet.
I love you and your every gesture will stay here inside my heart to remember your love for us, I love you.
I will miss you, you are a piece of me that will be greatly missed.
Why do I feel so bad and negative?
I went to the doctor and he said that all the pain I feel are caused by nervousness, and how am I going to stay calm?
Not everything went I’ve been through was as wrong as it's going now, but I STILL believe this year will be good.
Dude, sometimes I cry without noticing it and I bite my mouth to avoid collapsing in front of someone.
Listening to my dad's crap and watching my mom proposing ridiculous things makes me worse, even more nervous.
More useless pain, no pain that might help me grow or mature.
I just want my life back and I just want all this to be over.
My immunity can’t stand it anymore.
I went to the gym today, as promised.
It was full today and that sucks, it takes longer.
I met a new girl there, I think we're going to be friends.
But a funny thing happened, since day one, actually.
It’s my instructor, he sucks up to me, man, from the moment I arrive until I leave.
The other two times it was the same, but today it’s too much.
And I'm a person who doesn't realize when someone is interested in me, but in this case I'm suspicious of it.
Today I got there around  7 o'clock, he came smiling and said the things he had to do, and from equipment to equipment he kept telling me something.
"On the last equipment he stayed by my side and I said I was tired, then he said: ""If you wish, you can stay there until 10 pm, so we close the gym."
When I left he gave me a truffle, serenata de amor.
What’s worse, is that he's the only one there at the time I go, and I get embarrassed about that, right?
But, I didn't even dump him, specially because he didn't even ask me for anything, he just treated me that way, kissing my ass.
I'm having dinner, making out with the most handsome boy in the world.
Well, today my friends and I came up with the idea of ​​playing the Pen Game.
Maybe the way my friends and I play it wrong but it seems to be real.
Well my name is Daniele Felix I'm 15 years old and I don't have anyone to talk to so I chose here.
I'm upset with everything that's happening to me.
A few months ago I met a friend and he started hitting on me and I began to believe in him, he said so many beautiful things.
I was very sad because I liked him a lot and I was willing to do everything for him then the tears fell without control so I told my friend everything, she is helping me a lot.
But he left me as a second option.
I went to a barbecue at a friend's house, and I met her, her name was Carol, later I found out it was Jessica but that's ok.
I made out and then we went to a motel, that day I joked with her saying that she would fall in love with me.
I confess I really enjoyed making out with her, it was very nice, but I just left, I thought she wouldn't want to see me again.
After a while we ended up seeing each other again and dating more often.
But there was something about her that bothered me a lot, her way of seeing life was vulgar, she only thought of parties, going out drinking, enjoying herself, as if that were her main goals.
But now before breaking up with her, I'm feeling strange, I think I ended up liking her, her way of taking care of me, of wanting me to be with her all the time, her way of feeling jealous, and of always wanting me close to her, of she was always saying she misses me, that she doesn't mind spending time with me locked in a room talking, to be honest, I'm going to miss her.
I’ve been avoiding her recently, and it's squeezing my heart, but I have to do it, there's no way to keep on with this, and I'm very jealous and intolerant of these kinds of things, there's not the slightest chance that she and I will work out .
I will miss her, but that's life, sometimes we have to give up on something, so we can continue on our way.
Lately I've been very compulsive - for masturbation with the vibrator, for food, a little aggressive, shaking, biting, scratching myself.
It wasn't exactly a lay, but it was nice.
And we had sex twice in a motel - I didn't reach orgasm, to tell you the truth my dildo gives me more pleasure, but anyway, everything that gives pleasure I'm accepting.
During the last psychiatric consultation, he wanted to give me a neuroleptic (I refused at the time, I don’t want to gain weight) and in return he suggested a mood stabilizer.
He kind of suggested that I have borderline personality and bipolar spectrum (cyclothymia) anyway, nothing I didn't already suspect.
I did not accept the stabilizer for the same reason as risperidone.
I'm a fat whale, I don't want to get fat anymore and that's it.
Then he thought I was better and prescribed only one fluoxetine pill.
To be honest, having these hypomanic episodes is kind of embarrassing - but being depressed and suicidal isn't cool either.
I've been very stressed lately.
I fought with my mother because of the laptop, she didn't want to lend it to me to do my work and I burned myself with the candle.
I got a new laptop.
I burst out crying while having sex with my boyfriend, accused him of not loving me, of treating me like an object and told him to stop touch me anymore.
He wanted to have anal sex with me and was insisting a lot.
Okay, I over reacted, it didn't have to be that way.
Then he told me that I value and devalue him very quickly, that I constantly change my mood, some times I'm sad and at other times I’m super happy, and he asked me if I had any personality or mood disorders.
I am writing disconnected words because my mind is disconnected.
My thinking is confused and disorganized.
Yes, it embarrasses me, I like to be in control.
I'm in charge during sex.
I get on top of him, I ride him, I say I paid for this fucking motel for an hour and a half and I want to have sex for an hour and a half
Finally on vacation.
Well, my psychiatrist wanted me to try being on a single fluoxetine pill.
It wasn't even 2 weeks and I couldn't stand it and asked him to go back to the previous dose- 2 pills.
I was the whole time 'I want to kill myself, kill myself' I wasn't sleeping, anguish and screaming anxiety, crying over every little thing.
Lately, my sexual and aggressive instincts have been coming to the fore.
And I think I'm getting addicted to watching pornography on the internet.
Well, I can't take this anxiety anymore.
And I was particularly attracted to scenes of sadomasochism
At the same time they make me feel good and bad.
I remember my aggressions and humiliations and I feel bad.
I know, it's such a strange thing.
And I feel I'm some slut too, just like them - who am I to call anyone a slut anyway?
And the moans are so forced, it's more like they're giving birth than having sex - not sex, it's more like copulation.
But anyway, sex is sex, and it relaxes me.
I don't want to be a whale, I'm already too fat!
At least porn doesn't make you fat.
I can't stand being away from my boyfriend anymore - I fucking want to have sex!
He is on a trip and I’m in a dry spell.
He is now trying to control me.
I had another phase of mood swings ahead of him and he threatened to break up with me if I didn't take the mood stabilizers.
Well, I've been doing some research and the best thing I found was lamotrigine, which is not fattening.
Topiramato emagrece, mas fode com a memória, e pra uma universitária isso não é nada legal.
Well, I still don't know if I'll take it.
I'm afraid of turning into a robot.
Today my class went to the library after the break.
At break time I was there checking the books, to see which one I was going to choose, I didn't find any interesting.
"There was one called ""Biloca's diary"" is a small and short book."
It doesn't have that many pages and the writer wasn't known to me either!
"I picked it up thinking it was one of those children's books that say: ""Dear diary... Today I learned how to read..."""
Biluca is not a very well known name.
So, I didn't even have time to read a page of the book and it hit.
I went to the classroom and a little later my teacher took us to the library.
I rented the book and left.
When the librarian went to deliver the book, she almost dies of shame for having taken that book.
But I ended up reading it and I was really interested in it.
I've read half the book and I can see that it's totally different from what I thought.
It talks about an almost teenager (almost because she's still graduating and stuff) my God.
The discovery of new feelings, new actions and such.
After reading the rest of the book, I won't miss the chance to do the summary.
"Mom, I'm sorry for being who I am, for being such unique, for being ""different"", for being so wrong in your eyes."
I'm sorry, or rather, forgive me for not being the daughter of your dreams so perfect, for only disappointing you when you expected the most from me.
But it's just so hard for me to please you.
On the contrary, I love you very much!
I love you more than myself, after all you are my mother.
I don't hate you, nor my father, even though he's absent.
I hate myself for not being the daughter you always wanted and desired, and as much as I try - yes I do
I'm sorry I didn't grow up the way you expected.
You just don't know how it hurts when you disapprove everything I do for you.
You don't know how it hurts me when you put me down and humiliate me in front of anyone.
I just wanted you to be proud of me, but it looks like I'll never really be good enough for you, and I can't pretend that everything's okay anymore, because it's not!
I'm sorry but I will never be perfect and that, believe me, hurts me more than it hurts you.
I can't take our arguments anymore, they leave me in a state that I can't even explain in words.
And nothing will change the things you told me, nothing will make 'us' work again.
But mom, please don't give up on me like that.
I can't believe it's so hard to talk to you, to my own mother.
"Yesterday [Sunday] I couldn't write here because I was too ""busy""."
I went out on Saturday for my soon to be married cousin's bridal shower.
 My father, my sister, my boyfriend and my mother went together.
My boyfriend slept over.
I share a room with my sister, so I kept in my bed, he got the mattress (on the floor next to me) and my sister stayed in her bed, which is right on side (very close).
"We got back from the party and went straight to ""sleep"", my sister was the first to fall asleep, while my boyfriend and I were holding hands (he lying down and me too... and talking softly)."
Until suddenly my sister gets up and starts crying like crazy.
No final das contas, ela acabou indo dormir com o meu pai, e minha mãe na cama dela (da minha irmã).
My mother is very nice, she has a teen vibe and the head of a woman... she is always in a good mood, when we go to parties she dances, shakes things up, her vibes reaches everyone.
Her relationship with my boyfriend is great, they both play and I love that.
Then he hugged me, kissed me and we hanged around and talked for a while and then we slept.
I'm very cold, when I was in my bed, I took 3 covers and I was wearing a sweater.
As soon as he hugged me, I also started to feel hot and took off my sweater.
When I woke up, my boyfriend had his hand on my waist, hugging me, his head close to my hair.
He says that he got up before me, and kissed my face, and I didn't even move because I was so sleepy.
We got up and went out to buy my mom beer.
After a while, we lay down on the couch (it was already afternoon) because he wanted to watch the match on TV.
"When I woke up he hugged me, kissed me calling me lazy and said ""I love you"" He is so handsome."
We spent the rest of the day hanging out, we agreed to go to the mall so he could pay a bill, but who said laziness left it?
So that's it, I'm done here, today I'm very happy and I miss him already, we are clingy in our own way, and I love that.
It's great to have someone you love by your side.
Besides, waking up with hearing I love you makes the day wonderful and happy.
Anyway, Good Evening, and I would like to thank you for the comments on the previous subject.
Well it all started in April last year when my mother began dating a man I don't even know where he came from, well they were dating for a week and he was already living inside my house
On his birthday, I saw him hiding drugs in my room, and I went there and told my mother.
They fought and she broke up with him.
But then at 5 am I wake up with my mother screaming and asking for help, he had entered the house and was trying to kill her.
It wasn't enough to have a thug in our house, he wouldn't let my mother talk to me anymore, he wouldn't let go of her.
And in this song he says some things about love, and I think everything he says is simply beautiful!
A feeling of failure took over me, sadness, discouragement and a total dismay for life.
I feel my life is so messed up, I see my dreams dying, my life taking the opposite direction of what I imagined one day.
Why can I never feel complete?
My heart is torn apart today.
I arrived at work today so unmotivated, there’s so much to do but I have no incentive, I get angry when I think that I try so hard to give the best of myself in this company and people indirectly interfere with my work.
At home things go from bad to worse, my brother and my sister-in-law’s relationship just drags on, causing enormous suffering for my family.
I wonder what they are waiting for to break uo and end this suffering once and for all.
It's weird the way I still think about him, I want to call him.
I was very childish, the worst is that I still am, I'm not a little girl anymore, I'm a woman, there are things I can't avoid.
I see a lot of girls suffering for little boys who don't give a shit about them, so to get attention they pretend to be something they are not.
I think it's ridiculous, just get it, if he doesn't like you now, it’s useless, girl, in fact it might be, if you have a huge ass and big boobs, he might think about being interested in you.
But it's also useless if you want to wear a neckline, and shorts tucked up your ass, girls like that are only seen as a sexual object.
Well I did a survey with some boys and they said that girls who speak slang is normal, but too much seems strange.
The thing is, don't chase after him, I know it's hard not to show what you feel, but you can be sure, they don't value girls who chases after them, bothering them all the time.
If he brings up the subject, it means that he likes to talk to you, but if you bring up the subject, and he answers you with short sentences or takes a long time to answer and comes with apologies apologizing for the delay, it means that you are getting on his nerves and he only answers you out of politeness.
Before sending it, first check how the course was between the two during the day.
When you see him, give him a few glances, (but don't hide it) at first he won't understand, but stare at him for 1 second, and then gently move your hair looking elsewhere.
So he will try to guess what you want.
A lot of girls want to get attention from boys by laughing out loud or talking loudly, that's a little girl thing without attitude, and you don't want to be seen like that, right?
Post some independent girl sentences, as if you don’t need any man to be happy.
When the phone rings, my heart races
Loving you while watching the sun rise in the morning
But you know, it's strange to think that this is natural, I feel completely bad for him showing interest in others, I consider it a lack of respect.
Looking at shy glances at a beautiful woman is natural, what woman doesn't know that a handsome man has passed her by too?
But the question is, showing interest in another person, show that you are noticing, you know?
Saying life is made of choices is extremely easy.
Making the right choices is the hardest part.
At 27 years old, I imagine myself still studying something that interests me, if I have to study it all over again, I imagine myself with a respectful diploma in my hand, I imagine myself having gone through the best and funniest things in life.
I imagine myself visiting my family on the weekends and listening to the nonsense my dad talks and always will.
I imagine myself thinking about children, after all I have a dream: to adopt.
I imagine myself passing close to my parents' house and giving them  a warm bread in the afternoon.
I imagine myself at peace with myself, with everything I've done with my life.
I've never gotten dressed so quickly, and I'm glad I live a five-minute drive from my job.
Today my friend (Luciano) embarrassed me so much.
There is a health center near our school and I asked him to go there and get me a condom, because even though I am a girl, I think it is good to have a condom in case I have sex with someone I’d be protected.
I had to go to the lottery shops to pay some bills ('cause I always leave everything for the last minute) and the line seemed to be taking forever.
After an hour I got it, I took the bus and an horrible traffic jam.
It's my birthday I worked all day, almost 8 pm and I'm here in this horrible traffic, I'm going to get home just to sleep and today is my day I didn't enjoy anything.
It was perfect, my sister and my husband made everything, 2 types of pies, everything was so beautiful.
Thank you God for the life of my husband!
That way, you kissing me hot and doing everything you want between four walls.
Today me and my boyfriend had so much fun.
We were at the bus stop, we played like in the movies, he ran after me, grabbed me by the waist, tickled me, picked me up, lifted me up, taking my feet off the ground.
It felt so good for a moment to forget all my problems.
I went to the salon on Saturday to have my hair straightened, finally good hair and not bad hair, I couldn't stand that straw.
Always at night and I'm afraid, terrified and I never sleep in the dark, there's a small light that stays on, on my wedding night I wanted to do it with the lights on.
Today I went to sleep at 9 am because I had gone to sleep at my boyfriend's house without my parents knowing.
I had to go back home early as if I had gone to a club but I ended up not doing anything.
I had to go back home early as if I had gone to a club but I ended up not doing anything.
I took advantage of the fact that I had already woken up and called my boyfriend because we were going to see each other again.
I ended up meeting a person that I love her and she loves me too.
I'm seriously thinking about running away from home and taking a break, and then living with my beloved one!
I thought I would never love anyone in my life and that happens now after I'm old.
My God, I'm very anxious, I imagine me and my beloved one together all the time.
My husband has not been able to put anything in the house for 10 years, the bills are late, the fridge is empty, he is lazy!
I recorded a movie on TV, and now I’d like to watch it.
"The story tells of three chubby friends, who one day, get tired of being the way they are, get tired of seeing other people's mocking looks, get tired of not being able to do what other women do, get tired of being ""whales""."
So, they decide to make a pact, the cinderella pact, where they promise each other that they will do everything to lose weight.
And they succeed, they lose weight and become women with a perfectly normal weight, and much prettier!
But that changes today, because I will do my best, and I will be able to follow a healthy diet to lose weight.
And I'm going to prove to everyone that, like all the other girls, I can have an athletic body and be super skinny and perfect too.
Because I'm going to lose weight, and I'm going to prove to everyone that I'm not just any fat girl.
We've already left, and this is the third time I'm going to report it.
We had already booked by cell phone on Sunday.
Monday there would be a very nice sex in bed.
Well, we work in the same company, however, in different sectors, she is blonde, has long hair, she is delicious.
We set a date and there she was waiting for me in the parking lot.
"We left and during ""work hours"" we went to a motel called Beira Rio, which close to our work."
When we got there we went to a standard bedroom, super cozy and there it started, hot kisses all over my neck and I soon noticed that she was super horny.
I took off my pants and I was only in gray boxers and a black tank top, she went to the bathroom and came back wearing a killer red g-string.
She sat on top of me and rubbed against me.
However, being alone is the absolute opposite of being with someone.
Being alone is closing your hands on nothing when you run across the street because you don't have a hand to hold.
Being alone is sad, it bothers others and it’s probably be bad for your health.
M y mother and I found out that my stepfather was cheating on her.
I also found out that he was cheating on my mother with my aunt.
And on top of that he hit my mother.
He threatened me and said he would kill me.
I still can't stop cutting myself, I know it's a problem and all but it's hard.
Sometimes it comes to mind that nobody likes me, my mother is a pain in the ass and the only one who can be saved and with whom I still haven't messed around because he won't let me is Vinny.
Sometimes I feel sad, I'm 12 years old and I‘ve never Benn French kissed, most of my friends already did and the worst part is that I think I'm ugly.
I never loved anyone the way I loved you.
We are living in a world where physical appearance worths more than inner appearance.
Before taking the history test, we prayed this prayer and I still pray it to this day. It's been 3 years since I last saw the teacher who taught us this prayer, but I really like her.
True friendships: that's what the world needs.
Today was a day of so many surprises and joy I don't know how to say it but I still can't believe I'm waking up thinking about him at 5 am.
He said he loved me that he misses me that when he finished college he would come and get me.
I came here after the light came back, I was looking at a picture of him that I have.
And I don't know what I'm feeling right now but I feel calm happy but I don't know...
He completes me you the feeling when something is missing but you never knew what it was and then you find someone who understands you he is quite the opposite of you and then you feel complete.
Look, I'm not very tall, but tall enough for my age and I'm underweight.
Whenever you do those screenings at school, I'm always alerted because I'm below and I don't like that!
When I try to warn people are closer to me they say that if you're thin you must put on weight and stuff, but when I try to joke about the situation to alert them they say oh but you're not very tall either.
Besides, guys also like thicc girls. Not those who look like they are just skin and bones.
I don't have siblings and for various reasons I've learned that my best friends don't know how to keep secrets.
I seem very happy, because I learned that crying doesn't solve anything and that ended up making everyone trust me with things, because they know I'm very positive and secure.
Those who have dated and never missed their ex, throw the first stone.
When we are in love, there is such a blend of feelings inside us that we get lost.
I dated a boy named Luan, he is 3 months younger than me, and maybe my mistake was to start like that, because women mature before men.
But we had a perfect relationship, everyone was jealous.
His friends started to hate me because he just wanted to be with me.
We only cared about our own opinion, and we dated for 9 months.
On a certain day, we argued and I couldn't take it and I broke up with him
After that, we secret dated once in while so no one else could get in the way.
I just couldn't take it, being treated just as a friend in front of others and then later when we were alone there would be any kind of touch.
Pay attention boy, she laughs at your dumbest jokes.
She is interested in all your nonsense subjects.
So, she’s just there to put up with your talking about banal things, she just wants to see your mouth moving and the sound of your voice come out.
She doesn't mind listening to your loving complaints, although it hurts too much, she will always be there to support you.
She only cares about seeing you well.
When she gets on your nerves, don't argue, she just likes to see you a little irritated, because she knows that later you'll open a smile, and she loves that smile.
I see that I'm surrounded by fake people, naughty men lying when I think I've found someone different, it's a mistake, just another fake liar.
I'll learn to live without you, and God willing I'll be happy too.
I will always fondly remember everything I experienced with you.
Zootechnicians are professionals responsible for the study and control of reproduction, genetic improvement and nutrition of animals raised for commercial purposes, which aim to increase production and improve the quality of animal products.
They carry out experiences with food and research ways to guarantee hygiene conditions and to prevent and fight diseases and parasites, to improve the health of the herds and the quality of the products derived from them.
They also work as rural administrators and planners on farms and rural facilities.
Cholesterol-free eggs and light pork meat are examples of what genetic research in healthier foods can do.
Often confused with veterinarians, the zootechnician is, in fact, the professional focused on the development of production.
You traveled, you are far from me.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Because, I don't know if I'll be able to stand it.
Oh! Baby, you are my half.
I kill time by writing in this online diary.
I'm anxiously waiting for you.
Only you make me smile.
I want your strong hug soon.
Am I the only one who never had a cute, perfect boyfriend, even if it was just for a month?
In my love life everything is a BIG shit.
When a guy is interested in me sometimes I'm not interested in the guy or everyone is interested and it doesn't work out, something happens and that's it.
I know I should wait, but I waited too long.
This is the first record I've made here, and at the moment there's not much to talk about my personal life, so I'm going to reproduce something I wrote in a message.
Stay there and I'll stay here with my breasts, with their hard, protruding nipples, eager to be licked from top to bottom, from side to side, to be bitten lightly and sucked all over.
Nipples that can be tender like breasts, which are swollen and proud to be so cute.
These breasts that won't fit inside a hand, spread between the fingers, which you hope to squeeze them firmly, fingers that enter through the bra, appearing through the malicious neckline of the red blouse, and from inside the bra squeeze them gently , delicately, groping and pulling out everything that burns and throbs strongly inside.
A soft, hungry, warm mouth that will try to swallow him whole and won't be able to, she will lick him completely to compensate not being able to touch him entirely with her mouth.
The hands involving them while the mouth doesn't stop licking them as if they were ice cream, because they almost melt in the mouth.
And those beaks get harder and harder, provoking an impatient excitement, half nervous, of getting wet from being so anxious.
"My heart races, my hands are cold and a little shaky, I get butterflies in my stomach, and a strange feeling when he's around, and especially when we're alone, or even in a crowd, when he hugs me and says: "" you are beautiful today""."
At that moment I'm embarrassed, and shyness takes over me and when I realize it, I'm already in his arms.
I already totally forget where I am, and I stop caring about the people around me, when I'm with him, it's like there's only the two of us there.
I think living a romance is much cooler than just a thing.
Romance is indefinitely, while some thing has limited times.
I am enjoying loving and being loved, the best thing is to be mutually with good feelings.
May it be eternal while it lasts, and may it last forever.
I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH YOU, I WISH YOU ALL THE GOOD FEELINGS, ALL THE GOOD COMPANIES
"MAY THE LOVE OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE WILLINGNESS TO KNOW BE YOUR ""MARK"" IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ILLUMINATED SPIRIT."
MAY YOU BRING WITH YOU LOVE, WISDOM, PEACE, CALM AND THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE
"MAY YOU TEACH ME TO BE MORE HUMAN AND THE TRUE MEANING OF LOVE, AS LONG AS YOU ALREADY FORGIVE ME FOR MY EXCESSES TOWARDS YOU, MAY THIS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY BE ENJOYED AND MAY GOD HELP US DAILY TO BE ""MOTHER AND SON"" MAY YOU COME MY BELOVED SON."
I remember so many moments, so many good things that we did together, you were an angel to me.
I don't even remember exactly how I met you, but I know it was the best day of my life. For me, you are more than a friend, you are a sister from a different family.
You don't know how bad I felt about you changing school.
I want you to do well in life and love someone who also loves you very much.
We're starting to drift apart and you haven't even noticed.
But know that I miss you a lot, I miss your smile.
Man, I can't take Douglas anymore, what a boring boy!
He had disappeared, now he's back to bug me again.
I don't treat him badly, but man he just talks shit, I already said I don't want to be with him anymore, but he insisted in a way that suffocates.
I really wanted to have his friendship, but he always comes with ulterior motives, I'm almost ending it, in other words, excluding him.
Thus, he disgusts me, that even I don't understand why.
He stuck his tongue down my throat and I almost died.
Just imagining to hook up with him makes me want to throw up.
Today I go out with some friends.
I love them because they are very nice and fun, we love to laugh and play games.
On the way to this girl's house we found a gentleman lying on the ground as if he were dead or passed out, the strange thing was that the man had his eyes half open and turned upwards.
I found it super strange and I was very scared, but even so we passed the man and kept walking.
My girl senses told me something was wrong, so I asked Lucar and Victor to go back there with me and try to wake up the man to see if he was alive.
But I wanted to go back anyway, so we went back.
The boys tried to wake the man up in every way and the man didn’t wake up, so I decided to wake the guy up myself
I moved him, rocked him, turned him over and the man didn't wake up, until when I saw a bottle near his head I decided to pick it up and pour the liquid that was inside it on the man's head, that's when he woke up.
My mom had a huge fight with me about sleep schedules.
Then my crybaby self spent the night crying, until her eyes were swollen.
Thinking that the only way for my parents not to fight with me would be to die anyway, then I wouldn't bother anyone.
I took another antidepressant pill (I usually only take two) and went to listen to music.
After a while, I was dancing happily, as if nothing had happened.
And it was like that until 5 am, when I finally decided to go to sleep.
And no, it wasn't the medicine, because it takes a long time to take effect, it doesn't happen overnight.
Well, the important thing is that I'm better.
Today I made an appointment at the gynecologist.
We've never had sex, but I think it's closer than far.
I'm a virgin, or at least I've never had penetration.
The only thing we did was oral sex, him on me.
Sometimes I feel  kind of bad for being so dependent on others, not knowing how to do anything alone.
I'm jealous of my friends who solve everything themselves, know how to go everywhere easily.
University schedules were terrible.
She keeps throwing in my face that I don't know how to do anything, and then it gets into my head, and makes feel me even more powerless.
I fought with him and I deleted everything but the other week I saw more and more porn cartoons.
Oh guys, I don't like that, I don't know, I think it's a lack of respect to me!
But she is very special she is my best friend.
With the end of the term in college, I felt terrible.
It was a seminar, a test and an essay, all together, I was about to go crazy, especially because I hate public speaking.
I can’t manage it, I stutter, I forget, etc.
There was a subject that I reached the limit of absences, another one I spent fishing, there was a paperwork that I didn't even see the color of it, but they put my name on it, in the seminars I saved myself for the sake of others.
There was one that I gave up at the last minute and started crying, but I talked to the teacher and she gave me a huge alternative work, so I wouldn't fail.
I feel super bad that everyone performs well and I perform poorly.
As it is public, the level is very high.
And my inferiority complex only increases in these cases.
My psychologist asked me if I wanted a second opinion (both to see about the medication issue and to see if I really had BPD-borderline personality) and I agreed.
I went to the psychiatrist and she gave me risperidone.
I decided to accept it, because I felt really terrible (I still am, but at least now that I'm on vacation, I'm relieved).
I've always been a perfectionist, I always like to give the best of myself, especially in terms of intellectual performance.
I want to make up for what my college roommates did for me.
In a little while, no one will want to call me into groups anymore, if I continue to be this bad.
I want to drive a car, be independent, be a successful psychologist.
At least the college subjects will be nicer and more in line with the course.
Saturday the 28th of July was a wonderful Saturday.
I met a boy, kind, handsome and funny.
Maybe I met him two or more weeks ago, I don't remember.
But I remember perfectly when he told me that he liked me very much.
I wasn't surprised or anything.
I was already used to knowing that many boys already declared it to me.
The worse is that I liked him too.
You might think I'm crazy, I liked a boy I met online.
I'm tired of running after those who don't deserve it, now if you want to come after me, you know where to look for me and where to find me.
"They don't think like girls. So, don't treat them like ""friends""."
Men are naturally territorial, they are jealous and hunters!
It was just a blink of an eye, that I finally fell in love, and in the middle of the smoke, he also likes me.
Yes, I'm a preppy!
I'm a proud person, I don't hook up with everyone (because that's a bitch thing), I play ball, I talk to those who talk to me, I don't have many friends either!
My school is full of rockers and the preppy girls they had there just became sluts!
I am one of the only respectable preppies, who enjoys reading and who is not a whore.
Last Carnival there was a celebration at the school, all the classes were together, I preferred to go and read a book in the library, there was the music teacher and about three rocker students too.
I went in, excused myself and got romance book!
There was a boy who kept looking at me and it was bothering me.
I don't consider myself a lucky person.
I don't consider myself a person with feelings either.
But the biggest one is hate.
Many think I'm wrong, and that I'm talking a lot of nonsense, saying that there is a great hatred present in me.
But these people are just countless mortals who say what they want, literally, they don't know anything about me, and much less, about what I think.
Not that I consider myself an immortal, for me, everyone has the same fate.
But lately, strange things have been happening to me.
My family never cared about what happens or doesn't happen to me.
By the way, no one ever cared to at least know if I was okay, or if I needed help.
Nobody ever cared about me.
Love letters don't usually start like that, with explanations and reasons.
But I wouldn't have any other way of writing something I feel without trying to explain or give reasons even though loving exempts any kind of explanation and doesn't require reasons to happen.
I think that love comes from I don't know where, it grows I don't know why and it accidentally hurts you, maybe it's my only hope... or the last.
Not because I can't fall in love again but because whenever I desire someone, that person will be you!
That will be in my dreams you are different!
You are the only one responsible for what I feel. I give myself completely to you. If you want, I can name a star or give this star to you.
I can try to stop the wind or sit in the spring breeze, I can try to stop the sun or make sure you have a perfect day. I can try and do so many things for you besides making you love me as much as I LOVE YOU.
Well, if loving is thinking about you 24 hours a day, going out on the street thinking that I might cross paths with you at any moment and close my eyes and see your face, it might even be love!
And every day I will look at the sky and be grateful that I found you and that you were more than I expected. I will thank you for your look.
In that terrible state of depression that I found myself in, I didn't know what else to do out of so much despair, I felt an inconsolable pain, it hurt a lot, more than anything, or almost anything.
I found a solution, or rather, in my head it was the only solution.
Comecei a cortar meus pulsos a fim de trazer dor física e esquecer a dor emocional.
Incredibly, that made me stronger.
My friend Laura, the stupidest and dumbest of them all, started cutting herself in the middle of the classroom.
FUCK, AGAIN, she was called in the board, she gave the names of everyone who was in the game, and they were all called, one by one as if it were at the police station.
Then they found out that we had all cut ourselves, they thought we had made some kind of pact... they called our parents, but only Laura's and my mother went there and found out.
My weekend was okay, let's just say I expected a little more.
Last night my boyfriend came to my house, we didn't go out, we stayed at home.
And as always there was another DTR.
But this time it was nice, we talked a lot, I think he understood my side.
In fact, I think I managed to express clearly what I was feeling.
It was cool, after a lot of talking we ended up dating, amazing how that boy has the gift of driving me crazy and at the same time making me happy.
The moments by your side are always so perfect, you know.
When he kisses me, it's like millions of lights shine in my world, I feel like I'm floating in his arms.
When you hug me I feel protected.
As if no external problems could reach us!
I'm sure this is called LOVE.
And it's amazing how that feeling makes me feel good and bad at the same time.
Today I felt very lonely and instead of crying, as usual, I self-harmed.
I hit myself a lot, and bit myself 3 times.
I don't recommend this to anyone but I can't think of anything else to do when I'm sad because my friends and family don't understand that I'm sad for no reason and they'll call me an idiot and if I tell anyone I've self-harmed they'll call me sick, because that's what human beings do, they judge each other.
Life was freely given to us.
The power of reaction is within each of us.
There's no magic potion to be happy.
You just need to have a clean soul and devoid of sorrows and grudges.
Everyone is free to fulfill their mission the way they want.
Happiness is always knocking on our door, just open it and invite it in.
We will always have enlightened souls reaching out to us.
Alive, cheerful and communicative, these Gemini beings, light and relaxed, always seem to be on good terms with everyone.
Friendly as they are, they will always give the impression that they are interested in someone, but they are just chatting and looking for information.
Os geminianos sempre são muito expressivos e falam muito com as mãos, sempre contando fatos que lhes aconteceram com muita vivacidade
Their walk is kind of bouncy and happy, and they are always multitasking, like studying, watching TV and talking on the phone while talking to you.
It's not really that they're following fashion: they're always in fashion.
I'm well organized, paranoid, disgusted by almost everything.
I love children, and sometimes I look a lot like them, I love playing, jumping, in short... mess, I love happy and different things.
The truth is that I'm too intense and there's no one who can fix it.
I cheer with joys that do not belong to me.
The good thing is, every night before I go to sleep, I pray.
And I always smile!
Longing is the greatest proof that the past was worth it.
Really, I don't have the energy to get ready, to take care of myself, bad thoughts take over my head and I go into a state of despair.
I lent the money to my dad and I honestly regret it a lot.
Diego sent me away, he didn't want anything to do with me anymore, my mother turned her back on me, I only had my father and he asked me to withdraw the money from the bank, putting the greatest psychological pressure on me, wouldn't I?
Well, now it's no different, because anyway he's with me out of pity.
Now I'm here with all my cards having to be paid in installments (I'll pay triple the amount due to the interest), without a penny and on top of that with Diego fighting with me and throwing it in my face every day that I'm stupid and I borrowed the money for my father.
He doesn't understand why he never had to go through a hardship like this, but I'm sure if it was his mother instead of my father, he would have done the same.
Diego, on his turn, instead of being a present boyfriend, who supports me, who advises me and who tries to understand my side and help me, only knows how to judge me and fight with me because of it.
Yesterday, I was with my best friend in class, I arrived late and I had a little chat with my best friend.
Then came that crazy woman I told you about, that day I was embarrassed, and she wouldn't let me talk to my best friend.
Then the crazy woman spoke to her and I didn't even understand their conversation but I ended up keeping quiet.
Portuguese class was boring.
Hours went by, we went to the video room, it was a physical education class, what the hell!
I wanted to go to the court but the teacher wanted us to stay in the video room and watch the boring movie.
You promised me, I know, I remember, you swore that it would be forever.
You also swore that you would forgive my mistakes and my flaws, that any slip I had, you would forgive, because the good I did to you, would overcome any pain.
Forgive me, I made unforgivable mistakes, just as I have already forgiven, I made exaggerated slips, and it wasn't the first time, I lied for fear of your reaction, for fear that you would abandon me, I fought so hard alongside this fear, that nothing helped me, fear only made me lose you.
I can no longer hide the sadness, and tears have already filled my eyes.
I'm groundless, aimless, without dreams.
I find myself empty, without hope and after everything I've done to you, without the courage to ask you to stay with me.
I love you so much, I wanted you to know that, that you realized the acts of love, affection, dedication that I showed you.
I think about the future because it will be good for me and everyone I love.
I'm going to graduate, work, I'll do my best to keep the peace in my house.
I don't intend to seriously commit to anyone.
We think differently, we have different goals
I come from a family where the Father always supported the house to raise the children, while my mother stayed at home taking care of us.
We didn't have everything, but the essentials to become responsible adults!
I have several friends, I am an extrovert, happy person, I love to see happy people around me, I value Health a lot, because if we have it, we  can run after the rest.
But my husband is Materialistic, Moody, I say almost Bi POLAR, a good father yes, but not a good husband.
He doesn't have many friends, and ends up being selfish many times, if he needs to, he goes over someone to win something.
For me the simplest things in life are the best, I love visits.
And making someone happy is worth more than knowing my life.
I'm very happy with the approval, even though I know it wasn't really deserved.
But this time everything ended well, after so much pain and suffering due to the circumstances, everything ended well.
And it affected me so much, I was totally mad.
I still remember the sweet words you used to say.
I remember the smile you opened when you saw me, the explanations you gave when you couldn't call.
I still remember the times you looked at me and said how much you loved me, how much you wanted me.
I still remember the times you looked at me and said the fear you felt of losing me.
I still remember how much satisfaction I felt looking you smile.
I still remember everything I lived with you, and I miss our nights when you told me your joys and agonies.
I've been remembering those conversations, those laughs and also our secrets.
I always remember that smile of his, when I arrived sad, I felt embraced by him.
And I remember too, how you managed to cease my pain.
How I wish to go back in time, have you by my side, with your eyes lit up.
I kept them all in my memory, I will never forget them.
Our paths changed, but they didn't get lost, I'm still here, and best of all, I'm sure you're still there too.
If you need it, look for me, if you miss me, call me, if you have a problem, count on me, and if you have time, let's see each other!
I don't have that young look anymore, but my heart is still the same that loved you, that gave you affection, and loved receiving yours.
It may be that we see each other tomorrow, it may be that we only meet in a year, it may even be that time takes us further apart, but I want you to know that today I remembered you.
I promise to love you until the end of my life, until my last breath, until the last beat of my heart, until the last tear on my face.
Because now I know that it's you that my heart really chose, that it's you that I'll fight for until infinity and I'll wish for at all times in all dreams in all wishes in all my prayers.
I feel this desire every day, you know, even when I do, but hours later I already feel like making love.
My guardian angel named Douglas, besides being beautiful, was my best friend!
Because friends also say I LOVE YOU!
I can't think of him without laughing!
He called all the boys I told him to be a friend an idiot, he wasn't a boring friend, he stayed on my toes, but he never let me do anything wrong!
He was, and always will be my best friend, because he is not visible, but he is alive in my heart!
"This is a place for a lot of venting and I feel like a ""big mom"" for many who write here, because I'm older than most of the girls here."
Most of those who threaten to do it don't, but if you're wondering, I have a report to give.
A colleague of mine killed herself before the age of 30!
It scared many people.
She separated from her husband and couldn't stand it!
At 5 years old I almost died!
I had appendicitis with serious complications.
It's actually a miracle that I'm alive.
And it will be selfish of you to let others solve it.
I can't see a hot blonde in front of me that I'm already turned on!
So I don't know what else to do, hand myself over to death or wait a little longer?
Indirects affect my bad mood and only make you more disgusting to me.
Me and my boyfriend now, we've been spending a lot of time together, and we still have that dream of sleeping together, and waking up next to each other, you know.
And he still fucks you hard and then licks his lips of how good it was.
It was all so intense, a month felt like years.
After many tears and a farewell party my vacation was over, I returned to my reality and then my summer romance had to come to an end due to real world responsibilities.
I feel like a part of me is somewhere else.
Looking forward to a tight hug and kiss on the forehead.
My mind says it's crazy to wait so long, but my heart says it's possible.
Today I felt a very pleasant nostalgia for everyone and the place where I stayed.
Almost two months made me have a routine, a very crazy one, but a nice routine.
I believe this vacation was perfect because of that.
It was a gift from heaven.
Traveling with friends, with no family around, was the best thing I've ever done.
This freedom is really missing me right now.
This story talks about the relationship between women.
I woke up late, wanting to stay in bed, that desire to do nothing, simply vegetate!
I hate feeling lazy, I keep blaming myself for not enjoying the world when I'm doing nothing, but in the last few weeks I really feel like sleeping and forgetting the world around me.
The car, which I would like to buy, will have to wait after all, I didn't know that things for the house were so expensive, everything seemed like a dream or rather a nightmare.
When I got there, Helen welcomed me with a smile, but something in her eyes was different, then she told me that Erika was there with some friends dismantling the furniture.
As soon as you go up Erika will look at you with those disapproving eyes.
At nightfall we headed to the hotel closest to the house, with a good appearance, I felt more comfortable spending the night.
We went upstairs and entered room 42, a mirror in front, a large bathroom with antique ceramics, a huge bed in the bedroom, the atmosphere was similar to a Motel, but a little less daring.
She took off her blouse towards the bathroom, I kept looking at her curves, she wasn't thin but she wasn't overweight either, when I heard the shower turn on I felt my body warmer, I knew it was the first symptoms that my body gave of excitement .
I went into the bathroom and took off my clothes, looking into her eyes I asked if I could come in, she shook her head with a malicious smile and made a gesture that yes, she ran her hand over my body.
We woke up very early, went back to her house, soon the pickup truck would arrive, she had taken on a big responsibility.
Seeing all those bags packed, I realized what I was doing and that it really was a madness that I was starting to like.
I had already loved someone who never loved me, I did everything for my ex, and from one day to the next she left me, it hurts too much to love and have to live on crumbs, and in this short life of mine I have already suffered too much, so why not match Helen?
Why not make her happy, since she was willing to make me happy too.
Now with a more open heart, I drove the truck towards the new house, after thirty minutes we were close.
Life was cruel to me, since I was a little girl, already working as a shoeshine girl, always hungry and seeing everyone with a father and mother, and I was an orphan with living parents.
realized that there was almost no sun, and that the biggest difficulty would be the clothes, I realized that Helen wasn't happy, but I knew I would help her, my money was already running out, she with her dirty name and swamped with bills couldn't help me so early.
We barely started and the financial problems started.
Maturity knocked on my door early, I had to put food on the table early.
As long as I have strength, I will keep fighting, I think that's why I got a good job early on, I relate very well with people, of course the beauty of being of American Indian and Italian descent makes the difference.
That night I slept with her, the fights at my house were constant, I couldn't participate in my classes, I was distant from my family, and to make matters worse, my mother and I clashed a lot.
I moved back in with her. I was 11 years old when I was abandoned by my aunt, our relationship was very difficult, she repeated a million times that I was not her daughter, that I was a mistake that happened.
Until I couldn't take it anymore and started to clash with her, I left the house aimlessly, many times, and for the first time at age twelve I knew what depression was.
My mother called saying a lot, that I was irresponsible and that things couldn't stay like this.
Our first weekend arrived, I went to the market, prepared lunch, washed clothes, wow, everything was so delicious, and she was so happy, despite everything she always told me she was happy, and asked me to get married every day with her.
I only remember hearing the phone hang up, I knew I had lost my family at that moment.
That day in the morning was torturous, I knew my mother would talk a lot, she bursts out of nowhere and doesn't stop anymore, when she fights with my father she almost hits him.
At this moment I felt my life end, my heart was broken into billions of pieces, everything I conquered asking for, everything I once was was no more, tears were streaming down my face.
I felt angry with myself, with letting go of everything for someone else, with letting her talk to me like that, talking about her like that.
I went back to work listening only to her martyrdom, trying to hide my crying face, but deep down, I was totally lost.
It was six o'clock, and the taxi was waiting for me, I went back inside the house, hoping that everything was a dream.
I wanted to die, I couldn't name what I was feeling, it was a mixture of fear, despair, and an enormous feeling of loneliness, I've always been lonely.
Wow, how thin and beautiful you are. Let's go shopping for pants, I always do that with your sister, I think we can do that.
It was wonderful, perfect, for a moment I got my sister's attention effortlessly.
Now after three years I find myself in front of the toilet, I didn't do any kind of force, I just threw up like the old days.
I couldn't answer, I didn't cry, I didn't smile, I just sat on the bathroom floor looking at nothing, with an eternal feeling of well-being in the midst of the emptiness that tormented me.
I woke up with Helen looking at me, I knew she wasn't well either, but at that moment she was the only person I had and I was the only person she had, I took a shower, changed and was on my way out.
Everything will be fine! I'll arrive earlier today, I'll prepare the pasta that you like so much, you want something to drink, you slept without eating anything.
During the day, I could see my brother through the window, a handsome blond boy, we are much more than brothers, we share a secret, he is my accomplice and I am his.
And so another month went by, I didn't eat, I didn't live, I vegetated, and at the end of the day I threw up, Helen locked herself in the world of bills using my card, she didn't care about anything either.
My uncle was returning from Paraná where my aunt who raised me lived, he asked to talk to me about a very delicate matter.
Night was coming on when I heard the knock on the door.
Of course, I'm back from my trip because I'd like to know what's going on, he's brought unpleasant news about your aunt.
You will always be that little girl with blonde hair and a smile on the most beautiful face in the universe, I love you, don't forget.
I closed the door, Helen looked at me scared, I didn't say anything I just went to the bathroom, turned on the shower, got in with my clothes and everything, the tears mixed with the shower water, the door opened.
I can't, my life is over, I don't know what to do.
The following week it was raining a lot, I woke up during the night scared, the house was full of water up to the height of the bed.
In a few minutes, Helen came in a way I had never seen, it was true, it was much more than just sex.
After this experience, every time she wanted me to be a man in bed, I soon began to question the reason for these attitudes.
Two days after the flood I started having severe muscle pain, and a fever, it wasn't constant, seven days passed, I went to work my eye was huge, I thought I had conjunctivitis, I asked to leave the service, and when I was leaving I had a big surprise , it was my sister looking at me.
My God, that's why you're so red I think you have a fever, but why don't you go to the health insurance?
He gave me a big hug, a kiss and told me he loved me, I smiled.
Everyone in the room, including my dad, stood up, concern was visible on everyone's faces.
There I was able to reconnect with my family and get Helena closer too.
"I have everything a little teenager can have, friends, people who love me, ""money"", popularity, I have everything."
I don't have the touch of your hand sliding over my body, I don't have your hugs, I don't have your kisses, I don't have you in my life.
I do everything in my power, because for my life to be perfect, all you need is you.
Wow, today I'm ashamed and really, like really, HATING of myself.
You know today when I was leaving the garage at home I accidentally slammed the car and scratched it on the back, oh, man, I feel like crap.
And my husband saw it and rightly pointed it out to me as I am so distracted and STUPID for doing this and I admit I am wrong and I am most ashamed of him and myself for doing this.
I know it was unintentional but I have an obligation to pay a little more attention.
I have an immense desire to hit myself, such is the hatred I have for myself.
Yesterday I had a wonderful evening with my husband.
It won't be difficult for me to write this guide.
When you fall in love with a shy girl, you should know that she may falling for you too, but she will never take the initiative, not even to look you in the eye.
"So, you'll be the one to go there and talk to her about anything, usually just say ""Hi"" then ""How are you?"" and bring up an interesting subject, nothing too personal."
If the two end up getting along well talking, this will probably be a sign that she is enjoying talking and considers you a nice person, this is very important for everything to work out.
So, if you don't see each other anymore, call her and ask her out so you can talk.
She might even be a bit embarrassed, but if their conversation had been pleasant for her, she will surely accept the invitation,
Don't be quiet during the date, it will keep her quiet too and if she wants to tell you something, she may be embarrassed and remain quiet, so keep bringing up good subjects.
When asking her on a date, don't be trying to be difficult because that doesn't work with shy girls, be direct, talk to her and get exactly to the main point.
After she finally accepts, all red with embarrassment, here's a tip, never let her feel pressured by you, if someone makes a silly joke that might make her feel bad, defend her right away, always bring up nice subjects, I repeat.
I'm sorry I didn't take good care of you, little one.
I thought some things so banal were more important.
I'm sorry for making such a huge and unforgivable mistake.
I was such an idiot, valuing after losing.
But I still know that if I just went to play with you like I always do, you'd forget about everything and cheer me up like you always do.
Remember that Christmas I spent alone?
My father preferred my stepmother to me (although I was used to it, it was the first time he had done it).
You were there to help me when I needed it.
You licked my tears, and slept next to me whenever I cried myself to sleep.
At Easter, there we were, the same year, home alone again.
You were always there when I needed you, yes I feel I must repeat that.
How many people are really worth knowing, and are your real friends?
When my parents divorced, I had nothing left.
I think I was old enough to be eight or nine years old, honestly.
Only you knew that I didn't cry because I was alone on those dates we used to celebrate, but I cried because my father was all I had left, and I was simply his second option.
So I'm left with you.
You were just stolen from me, weren't you?
I knew you were gone somehow, but I wanted to avoid it, I wanted to lie to myself.
The truth hurts, it always has.
"Then my dad just walked up and said something like ""You heartless person, haven't you noticed your dog isn't there anymore, that they've stolen it?"""
Even so, at that time I looked for you.
I looked like never before.
I looked everywhere in the yard, and I went out in pajamas through the streets of Curitiba looking for you.
At night, I cried.
I cried more than at Christmas and Easter, I swear I cried.
I don't know how it was possible, but I cried for six hours straight.
"It didn't improve the situation when my father saw me crying and started screaming ""stop crying, you're so childish"" and scolded me, cursed me all over."
"I just thought ""Doesn't he see that I just lost everything I had?"""
I felt like the most groundless person in the world.
Dog, thank you for being there while I was bullied and anorexic over stupid comments that wouldn't have changed my life if I didn't care.
"Thank you for being there when I thought about committing suicide, I looked at you, and I thought ""I have to stay to take care of you."""
Nobody believes me, and some even laugh, when I say that my dog was everything to me, and that he saved me from suicide, but I think some would understand while reading this text.
I still spend every Christmas thereafter alone, and Easter too.
Not on purpose, the whole family simply forgets about my existence.
"My mom won't even let me go out with her, and takes my sister, and then she still complains that she's the ""unloved"" in the story."
Well, those days, I always miss you.
I regret crying before having you by my side, and now I feel that I have real reasons to be like this.
Thanks for changing my life and saving it.
Honestly, without you, I would be dead already.
This is a phrase I usually say to someone who asks about my life, but no one gets it.
There are few that I explain myself.
It has to be for someone who really deserves the story, and has the patience to listen to it.
Now I'm sustained by memories, you know?
Not having you anymore, I guess that's all I have left.
I can't hold on to friends that I know won't be with me like they say they will.
I hold on to memories because many of them don't come back, many people have changed, but the memories don't.
When I looked back, he barked, wagged his tail and did a sexy pose that seduced me, I want him.
I don't know if you remember this, dog, but I do.
I don't know if you're alive, but I know that wherever you are, you're in my heart, and I'm with you little one.
That promise I made you that Christmas, and I hugged you tight.
I still have your collar, your food bowls, everything that belonged to you.
I dare not throw any of that away, because that's all I have left of you, isn't it?
Maybe I'll donate it to some dog that needs some love.
It would be mean to miss one while I have it and I just don't notice it because I'm attached to it.
It's in the heart and soul, and I know you watch over me, little one.
The boyfriend is not mine.
Well, for a long time I wanted to vent what I THINK about the BOYFRIEND of a FRIEND, one of my closest friends.
I've already said some things to her, but it's complicated to talk about someone else's boyfriend, right?
She's been dating for almost 4 years, broke up once, but not for long.
They live in different cities, but they are close.
And he doesn't care if her parents don't like it.
He doesn't care about anything.
He's 20 years old, didn't finish high school (DUE TO LAZINESS), DOESN'T WORK, and is a gym fanatic.
Wherever they go, the bill is ALWAYS split, evenly between the two.
She can't go online when he's at her house (except VERY FAST) because she has to be ALONG WITH HIM.
She can't go out here without him, just stay home!
I've never dated long distance, but I don't think it would be easy!
He turns off his cell phone at dawn and the next day says the battery is dead.
"He leaves at dawn and says he went to buy a “dumpling""."
The funny thing is that he almost never has money to spend with my friend, he always has to share it, but for BRAND NEW CLOTHES, SNEAKERS AND gym he always has!
The funny thing is that he almost never has money to spend with my friend, he always has to share it, but for BRAND NEW CLOTHES, SNEAKERS AND gym he always has!
She herself has already said that he is super MATERIALIST and cares a lot about himself.
They don't trust each other, she has already told me clearly that she doesn't!
Last night when I got back from the course and was going to have dinner I felt the kind of pain I always feel in my leg, my leg paralyzed, Fernanda took me to the living room, my father was having dinner, when I went into the living room I started to shake and felt dizzy with a ringing in my ears followed by numbness in my hands.
Nanda called SAMU but it didn't helped much, they couldn't come, but my father took me to the ER, there I was attended quickly, the doctor did not know what I had and he prescribed me a medicine to stop shaking, the medicine was intravenously, that is, I would have to take it along with IV drip.
Then I panicked I couldn't take the medicine, I was very nervous and scared, my father didn't understand the phobia I have of needles and he fought with me in front of the nurses.
My father held me by the arm and wanted to take me to take the medicine, at that time I was already in a panic attack and I couldn't stop crying and I wasn’t even thinking anymore.
I went back home my father fought with me, only my sister understood what I was feeling I cried almost the whole night.
I suffered a lot for not being able to take the medicine and I suffered even more because of the brutality of my parents not understanding that people with phobias are not frills.
Yesterday I argued with my older sister, she is very annoying and stuck up.
Yesterday she was at work and my cousin said she had chocolate, and I'm crazy about chocolate.
Well, today I start writing my virtual diary, since I don't have a single friend to listen to me when I need to.
My name is Edvania Lemos, I am married and I have a 12 year old son.
I got married early and I don't think that was a good choice.
When we are young and in love, we see everything as a fantasy full of good things and then we throw ourselves body and soul into the life we think is perfect.
Anyway, this is how my dilemma begins, I had a boyfriend when I was 14 and I stayed with him until I was 16. I got pregnant and everything went downhill.
I was very nauseous and my poor boyfriend was the one I was the most nauseous of and that's why we moved away and with only 4 months of pregnancy each one went to his side literally.
They were wonderful to me, they supported me and helped me with everything.
But out of my own conscience I decided to support my son myself.
Well when my son was 5 months old I met a friend of my sister, at first it was a friendship more than 15 days ago we had our 1st kiss and wow what a delicious kiss it was passion for sure.
He immediately took care of me and my son who was still a baby, and everything was perfect!
He was sooo kind and passionate he took care of my son and me like a real man he literally took it, it seems that my son was his biological son a perfect father as everyone should be.
We dated until my son was a year old, then we got married, bought our house and started a life together.
Everything was going well, he was in the army, he didn't earn much, but it was enough, with 2 years of marriage he was promoted to sergeant and of course everything got much better financially.
Sex wasn't so good anymore and my husband was very silent and quiet with me.
With regard to our son, he has not changed at all, he has always fulfilled the role he assumed perfectly, a great father, I would never complain about that.
One afternoon he came in telling me he had to go to an event at the barracks.
he was even mad because he said he didn't feel like going, but he said it was necessary.
Like the good wife I've always been, I ironed his best uniform, shined his boots, groomed him beautiful and smelling nice, he kissed me and left.
He arrived at 00:30 I was waiting for him anxiously because we always slept together and that's why I was waiting for him.
When he came in it was strange, he went straight to take a shower, not even a kiss as usual, it was strange but we made love and slept.
This happened on Wednesday night, and on Sunday I was making lunch and my husband was watching football with my son.
Then someone clapped at the gate, that's where my life would fall apart, it was a man and my husband went to answer it and, oh God, he was pale nervous I didn't understand why, and I stayed at the door, my disappointment and anguish were huge.
Hello, who never suffered for love or passion?
I think most won't even respond, just because they've had such a bad experience with those.
There are so many good and bad situations involving love and passion that there is no way to describe them all.
I like a boy for almost three years.
Within that time (which is not short), I had good and bad times (more bad) and I can't seem to get out of it!
Even when that someone gives you proof of how much he is not interested, you keep finding ways to reverse it.
When he makes it clear that he DOESN'T LIKE YOU, you cry or/and are sad for a few days, but then you think of some way to make him see how special you are.
After once again having proof that this someone doesn't want me, I decided that I'm going to forget him.
No one deserves to humiliate themselves, cry, in short, suffer for a person who does not appreciate or does not want to receive their FEELINGS.
This is the advice I leave for you: VALUE YOURSELF, EVERYONE HAS A SOUL MATHE!
My love and I, we were born for each other. We just need someone to introduce us.
I'm upset and disappointed.
My mother assumed that she was prejudiced against my boyfriend because he was black.
I told her that it doesn't matter to me, but I feel like she doesn't support my dating.
Everything was very nice very nice
I decided to cut my bangs.
Except for the fact that the idiot hairdresser got it wrong.
And cut my bangs to the middle of my forehead and crooked.
We place so much trust and so much feeling in people.
In people we thought we knew, but who, in the end, only proved to be like to everyone else.
And for expecting too much, dreaming too much, creating too many expectations, we always end up disappointing ourselves and hurting ourselves more and more.
The attitude of a fool in love.
But I really thought that everything would work out, that when I opened my heart you would, I don't know, say you felt the same way, I swear I thought it was going to be like this.
In my dreams I imagined your mouth saying the words that would make me happy, that from that day on it would be you and me forever.
But that's not what happened and nowadays we're not even friends anymore, a friendship of more than five years ended like this.
But between being your friend or an acquaintance I prefer a thousand times to be your friend I miss our chats, laughs, jokes anyway I miss you in my life!
I wanted to share with you about my relationship, and say what many have already told me.
I met my boyfriend on my 19th birthday, we were taking a technical course at the same technical school, and a mutual friend introduced us.
As I had already been deeply disappointed in another relationship (in fact, in almost all) I didn't even pay much attention, but later I got to know him better and I started to like him.
I'm currently 20, and he'll be 29 in April, I prefer older guys, I'm happy with him and that's what matters.
Once, I had less than 1 month of dating when my niece was born, and my boyfriend went to the hospital to meet her and a part of my family, who by the way adores him.
My mother took a picture of me with him, my niece and our friend (the one who introduced us) who works with him, she is 42 years old.
Then my mother went home and I went to the course with my boyfriend and our friend, when I arrived mother told me that she had posted the photo on her orkut.
"Girl, I just saw a picture of Miih with her boyfriend on your orkut, don't get me wrong, but he must be a lot older than her by now"""
This person who posted this is 56 YEARS OLD and WAS MARRIED AT THE TIME TO A 24 YEAR OLD GUY.
I got REALLY MAD!
I almost curse that woman from top to bottom, it's very disrespectful, who is she to criticize my boyfriend?
Nothing against it, of course, but people should see each other more, at least I think so.
Then time passed, and I entered the federal college (today I study in a private one, a subject for later) and right away I made friends with the class.
A colleague took my cell phone and saw my photo with my boyfriend.
My boyfriend doesn't seem to be that much older than me, but that pisses me off, because love doesn't depend on age.
If he was 50 years old and I loved him, I would have him with no problem.
I get upset, obviously these ridiculous comments don't affect my relationship, but I think human beings should be less indiscreet and more considerate of others.
Lately I’ve been fighting with my mother EVERY day, we fight about everything, just yesterday I was fighting with my younger sister Bruna, for messing with my things, and my mother already fought with me.
My mom says I'm too rebellious!
But I think it's because I'm approaching adolescence and everyone gets like that at this stage of life.
5 years without the person that matters most to me in this world.
5 years ago I lost my reason, my hope, I lost my will to live.
But unfortunately I don't have her, and I'm still alive, so I have to live, even without her.
I continue, for her and with her.
I love her more than anything in this life, therefore I love my life.
I must lift my head and keep on, because I know that she really wants that, that I follow my dreams, that I become someone.
And you can be sure, Mom, I will make you very proud.
Did you know that the boy who will value you the most is the one who can't get to you, the one who looks at you and when you realize it, he lowers his head or smiles, who can't look you in the eye, and when talking to you, he smiles like a fool, and often ends up saying some unrelated, rather stupid things, but did you know that he does that because he wants to wipe a smile off your face?
And because he's too embarrassed to hit on you, it's shyness.
Did you know that those boys who barely say hi have the truest words to say to you in your ear.
They just wait for that one day they’d be able to say, an opportunity, a chance.
So, why do you, girl, keep being interested in that boy who has the courage to approach you right away, talks about your appearance, looks at your body and compliments you, trying to win you over for what you are on the outside.
Because the same boy who has the courage to come up to talk to you, has the courage to talk to another girl minutes later, and repeat the same words to get where he wants to go.
While the shy boy spends hours rehearsing something to say when he sees you, and remembers your smile, your look, even your way of talking, each of your expressions.
The boy who doesn't have the courage to approach you, has admired you from afar for a long time, and knows you much more than you can imagine, and much more than what the guy with attitude claims to know.
My friends found out why they took me by force and took off my coat to see what I was hiding so much.
But I only have this way of expressing what I feel.
Today I am very calm, like a lot.
You know, I spent most of my life worrying about everything, angsty, sad and depressed.
I thought about following the rules, playing the good boy, worrying about what others thought of me.
Fuck you, today I don't care what you think about me, I don't care about your popularity, you're lying through your fucking teeth, piss off.
I don't care about appearing to be a good son when you're a terrible mother.
Fuck family, I didn't ask to be born into this shit, want to bad mouth it,  do it, but look up to it later.
Eu não to nem ai pra tua autoridade, se você eh meu chefe, minha mãe ou o presidente do brasil, pra falar comigo você pede por favor e depois fala muito obrigado.
Don't talk loudly to me, because no one speaks loudly to me.
My politeness depends on yours!
I don't care about your car, your motorcycle or your wife, if I want, I'll run after it.
I want you to shove your envy and your falsehood up your ass.
Don't preach to me about your god, I have my beliefs and I don't need anyone honking in my ear and preaching things that he doesn't even practice.
Don't come and tell me that to serve God you have to be inside your damn church throwing money up your thief pastor's ass, and fuck you if you think that's why I'm going to hell.
Don't come and talk about my religion, you bastards, who are you to think about something, you bunch of shit, you put the bible under your arm and think you're serving God, and at home you curse your mother, you only think about money, fuck with the girlfriend.
Fuck social rules, I don't need to be perfect for anyone, I'm happy the way I am!
Fuck you all who don't like me, do you think I depend on your friendship?
I don't need to give you explanations for where I'm going or what I'm going to do, not even your shitty life worries me.
I don't care about anything, about anyone, fuck it, I'm happy the way I am!
Running down the street, coming home covered in dirt, games of hide and seek, cops and robbers, tag.
I miss playing with dolls, watching chiquititas on TV, and listening to Sandy and Junior.
Playing camp at my grandfather's house, and the strange foods he made!
Time when you only went to school to play.
Playing kitchen with the neighbors!
Going to your best friend/brother's house just to watch tv, and take a bath in his 1000 liter pool.
Playing goal with my older brother.
On rainy days or when I had a nightmare, running to my parents' bed, or sleeping on the side of his bed and making my father sleep all night with his hand on top of me, otherwise I couldn't sleep.
My grandfather, teaching me my homework and trying to pull my loose tooth.
School friendships were true.
Declarations of friendship and crazy drawings in the school notebook.
Just know how to live, know how to be free, love and be loved, know how to make and be happy!
Those who despise small events will never make great discoveries, small moments change big paths.
Once again I'm here lamenting, I'm devastated, my husband he lied to me, he created a facebook profile hidden from me, added several women, including ex-girlfriends.
I spent the whole night awake, I cried a lot, I thought even more, however, not being able to reach a conclusion I want to drop everything and leave.
Going back to live with my parents and erasing my history with him.
I'm just afraid of not being able to, of regretting it, I'm distressed not knowing what to think, I really wanted to vent to a friend but I don't have it.
What he did to me was a betrayal and it hurts a lot.
Today my boyfriend is going for a birthday party, he usually comes to my house every Saturday.
He is sad and I am sad.
I actually didn't even want to wake up today.
Lies kill, but doubt tortures.
My friends came over to the house to make an all you can eat pizza party, very nice, I ate too much, we watched a movie, and they are sleeping here at the house now.
I love my boyfriend, we've been through so much together and he is without a doubt the best boyfriend anyone could ever want.
I've always been alone and it seems like I get more alone with each passing day, my head hurts and my tears can't stop.
These feelings started when I was 14(I think), I don't know what went wrong in my life.
At the age of 14, I saw my parents fight, several times my father left the house, my parents argued with me, and I came home, you know, running to my room to cry.
No one, not even my parents or my brothers, would ever know why I was crying.
And it's like this until today, suffering, fighting with my parents all the time.
Today my life is a big shit, I feel so imperfectly strange a freak, I HATE MYSELF!
Why am I not pretty, why am I a fool, why am I not the way my mother wants me to be, not how my family wants me to be.
I hate it when I'm so good and people take advantage of it, I hate it, having to hide all my suffering and my pain and keep it in my heart, I HATE MY LIFE!
And My life will never ever be something I can call life, my friends (colleagues) seem to have a better life than mine, I don't want to have to hide that I'm suffering anymore.
I'M SICK, and my family seems to see how I feel, all they do is complain, fight with me, call me names, hit me, I'm getting so weak that I'm giving in to this feeling of pain.
I argued yesterday with my grandmother, my godmother because she didn't trust me to go to the bakery to buy bread, she told my grandfather to follow.
It's enough, I can't take it anymore, I had an argument with my aunt today with my mother and I'm crying and it feels like I'm alone again and like I always was.
My tears don't stop falling, and you know what comes to my mind, death.
I feel so alone and so hurt inside, my broken heart is visible in my eyes and I turn up the music so the neighbors don't hear my screams of pain, as if my world is falling apart.
I see that the rain falls in line with my tears, I see that the day is horrible and I see the consequences in my body.
Alone in a world where only false feelings matter, where everyone believes in lies for fear of admitting the truth, for fear that the truth is not what you expect.
Rodrigo my friend, he said he would come back to talk to me on msn, I consider him like a big brother to me.
Oh, in addition to all the suffering I'm feeling right now, there's also the matter of my parents not wanting me to date such a special person, you know.
I want to cling to you and never let go, feel your hands caressing my hair and say you love them again, hear your laugh.
My day was good, I woke up early, I helped my mother and father to organize my little party, I took my friends, I ate a lot of barbecue and cake, we had a good time.
I called Nando all day to see if he would come to my party.
I got a little angry that he didn't answer my phone calls.
So I asked my mother to let us go to the cinema, she did it, we cut the cake and went to the cinema, we went to see the avengers, very cool.
I bought myself a book.
I went to look at my cell phone as usual and saw a message there.
When I read this message I thought I'm going to call him and see how he's doing, and try to advance what about he wants to talk to me.
We started the conversation and everything was fine until he said he was going to come back just to see if they let him lean on work or to sign his resignation letter.
My heart broke into a million pieces, I started crying right away, he asked me not to cry, and said that it's hard for him too.
He's only doing this because he can't stand his mother anymore and that when they fought he took all his clothes and put them in a bag and she made the biggest mess with him.
Today I woke up and saw your side of the bed empty.
Your scent is still there somehow in my imagination.
I always closed the window and argued with you for having it open.
And now the window is always open like you always asked me and I didn't even notice.
I fought with you for leaving the TV and the lights in several rooms on.
And now they're all on and I didn't even notice.
Your side of the closet is empty and I didn't fill it.
Your side of the shoe rack was full of shoes that never ended and I always complained about the mess.
In the bathroom your drawers are empty.
The window is not with its dozens of shampoos.
There's something left in the closet and I don't know if it's yours.
It's a travel toothbrush that my mother may have forgotten when she came to pick up her things.
On my computer I have countless pictures of you.
I have countless pictures of you with other people I hate.
I hate not because they did something to me, but because you gave yourself to them.
Despite all the hate, I miss you.
Holidays or weekends arrive and I count the hours to go to my parents' house.
I haven't been looking for friends or anyone else.
When I was with you, I complained that I didn't have time for family and friends.
Now I just don't complain about anything, I keep quiet and keep it all inside.
The urge to cry returns.
My eyes start to fill with tears.
Before I met you I had many friends.
I left home early and came back very late, that's if I ever got back.
I went around the world enjoying everything I could with no time to end.
I had no fears.
I had loves, conquests.
I did that because I didn't know what love was.
She goes out with her friends, goes out with the boys.
I've asked myself that question and come back three times and today the suffering is a thousand times worse.
This time I will have to be strong.
I'm not a person to tell dreams or real facts, but as it was an experience of such proportions, I'm giving up.
I'm having a relationship with a person at work, yes we work in the same company but in different places, to describe him is talking about a tall man, with a voice that makes you wet, yes it is a voice that needs no comment.
His body is a show that makes you want more, his smile is as naughty as the owner himself.
We had not been in touch for a few days, when he called me asking if I had forgotten him and why I had disappeared.
"We went, meet, but we were thirsty for each other, I felt his member in me, that while, we were ""devouring"" each other with kisses that made the mouth water just to see."
He moaned in a way that made me very excited.
When he turned me around, he kissed me so hard that we started to come together.
My body was shaking, more than his, my legs were wobbly.
We shower together and when we were drying off he throws me on the bed and his mouth makes me moan.
My head and heart were racing so fast, I kept waiting for him so I could come.
This time he made me come in such a way that my whole body shook.
After 6 hours of pleasure we left the motel.
But I was still ecstatic.
"I met a friend of my sister's these days, he's 17 years old and from what I've noticed, he's pretty player. So I decided to ""study"" your type and I'm going to give some tips to the little girls in love who read this."
Today will be the day that he will be completely and madly in love with you if everything has gone well.
Give him all the love in the world without falling into temptation.
Today I'm very upset, I think I'm being cheated on, my husband is treating me differently and very coldly.
He has already betrayed me once and I forgave him, he is acting the same as before, treating me with the utmost coldness.
I spoke to my ex.
We only know things by living, many judge.
Only one who really knows it's me living, feeling it.
He said he doesn't want me to be separated, he doesn't want to see me alone.
He said he really likes me, and asked me to be patient.
I should only separate, when he separates.
All I want most is to work out with my husband, to live an intense love with him.
Pronouncing that I admire you, that I like you is too little.
For this friendship of ours deserves more than words, it deserved to be told to the world, so that everyone could feel, and maybe even understand, the meaning of our friendship.
But lately I can't stand it, it's like I need something more, you know, or rather, I need, I need you.
What I'm feeling for you is something that even I can't explain, I tried to get involved with many, I tried to forget you in many ways, but I can't, it's stronger than me.
I didn't even get a kiss from you, but I can say that it wasn't necessary for me to fall madly in love with you.
I wanted to forget the light in your eyes, so I wouldn't miss them, I wanted to forget the tone of your voice, your way of speaking, I wanted to forget that beautiful smile that only you have.
I wanted so much, but I can't, because what I feel for you is so strong, impossible to forget.
But one thing is certain, I love you very much and even though I want to forget you, I love you more and more, today more than yesterday, tomorrow more than ever.
Being without you is having the notion of time and not knowing how to fill it, is losing peace and knowing the absence of someone present.
Waiting is painful, forgetting is painful, but not knowing what to do is the worst kind of suffering.
I've waited so long to get to this point, I don't know what else to do, I'm afraid of losing your friendship, or rather, I believe I lost it, because you don't even want to accept me anymore.
But the fear of you distancing yourself from me is greater than anything.
Pay attention to the music I listen to and the things I post.
In the way I treat you, in how I care about you.
I really needed to tell you this, I couldn't take it anymore.
When the has night come, it’s time to sleep, I lay my head on the pillow and my thoughts transport me to a wonderful world.
I think I'm in his arms, huddled and shy, passionate and fulfilled.
I feel the strength and warmth of the man of my life.
I dream about you all night and I feel anxious and insecure for not knowing if one day I will turn this dream into reality.
Do not be astonished by this confession.
It really is a bold declaration of love.
I don't want it to disturb you and take away your peace.
On the contrary, I would like to always be by your side to love you and give you a lot of affection.
I want all the peace of mind for you.
Think about it, know that I love you so much, I really want your company.
I want to give you all my love.
Cover you with kisses and satisfy all your desires.
That's all I had the courage to dream of, hoping to one day see this claim come true.
Now you must know why I can't stand your girlfriends, because they were always with the boy I really love and the one I want to be with and always wanted.
It may be that what I said doesn't matter at all, because you started a new relationship not long ago, but I needed to express myself anyway.
And I hope you understand me, because I didn't ask to fall in love, because the heart is in charge of us.
Honestly, love is not chosen, it just happens.
Things happen at the worst times, it's part of that long journey called life.
I woke up as usual at 6:20 am to go to school, got ready, and went.
Arriving there I spoke with my friends and went to the corridor where I wait for my boyfriend every day until 7:20, he then arrived, put away his school supplies and came to talk to me.
He walked over to me, gave me that really tight hug and said I love you.
He asked if I was better (I've just been crying lately), I told him I was normal, but I can't fool him, he knew I wasn't well.
As I entered my room, my eyes filled with tears, I had to contain myself, because the girls who claim to be my friends would only want to know why I was crying and would criticize me.
So I spent 3 classes holding myself back so I wouldn't cry and trying to study, because I was going to take 3 tests after the break.
So after those 3 hours, the break came, I met my boyfriend again, we went downstairs together and went to the patio to sit as usual in the same place we sit every day.
I was dying to cry so I held back the tears and told him I couldn't look at him that if I looked at him my eye would start to water.
It was complicated, because I couldn't concentrate on anything else, what I wanted most was to finish those exams and go home crying everything I held back.
When the test was over, I went downstairs and found him in the courtyard, he took the book from my hand and we went to the station, when we got there we sat down and started talking, conversation went on, conversation came.
I confess that I was very upset about this, because I never stopped thinking about him in these 10 months of dating, I always gave him things on commemorative dates, when I got home, I cried a lot.
My boyfriend and I then got into an argument over the phone and I started crying.
I love him so much and I never want to lose him, because he is the reason I smile and for my happiness!
We always say that we are not going to fall in love with the wrong people, but without realizing it, we are already enchanted by the person without even knowing them well.
Giving ourselves too much, believing and we always suffer from it.
We surrender our heart, pride and all our love.
And how many times have we cried for the person who doesn't deserve a drop of our tears, we run after them and we don't see the truth, and many times we don't want to see them, because the truth hurts and hurts a lot.
And when we find that special person who makes you smile, forgets your past and makes you think about the present, we don't stop thinking about them, we become obsessed with them, we learn to like what they like and do what they do, just to say that we have a lot in common,
And when you wake up, you already wake up with her in your head, thinking that I miss you, and dreaming big, putting that person in our life.
Many times that person hurt our feelings without even knowing what we feel.
The worst thing is when we get attached to that person and they leave, not knowing that the one they stayed with is still in love, that they can't imagine their life without them, and we say life goes on, but a part of us they take with people that go away.
Our heart is always the victim, it's always in pieces.
It fires when the person gets close and hits harder because it already thinks it's your other half.
And when that person comes close to us, the hand shakes, the heart races, our world becomes different, because the person is too special.
People would like to vent with you my story with my family.
My mother was a single mother, I had no father.
She had 5 children and none had a father.
She was always considered by her relatives as nothing, she had no money, she was sick and very unhappy.
When I was three years old, I went to live at an aunt's house, as my mother was unable to raise me.
This aunt, despite giving me everything, was a demon, she screamed at me, let other relatives mistreat and beat me, sometimes she beat me, she grounded me in places where I was scared to death, in short, she was and is a fake witch , disgusting and bad.
When I returned to my mother's house at the age of 13, my older sister was in a life of drugs and wrong things, she always beat me, used my clothes and left them dirty, lent them to her drug addict friends, teased me in a way that I felt like disappearing from that hell.
When I thought I would have peace, my older brothers were very aggressive, they hit me for anything, in fact, they didn't hit me, they beat me, once my brother kicked me in the belly, I had my period for almost ten days .
I remember that I ate a lot at school so I didn’t have to eat at home, and I took showers in secret, it was very sad.
Until I was 15 years old, I practically ran away from home and until today, at 20 years old, I haven't come back.
I got help from someone to rent a house, buy furniture, go to college and have a life more or less.
However, nowadays that I have a better financial condition than my family, they want to take the little I have.
My mother only calls to ask me things, she is not able to come visit me, to be present in my life, when she comes to my house, she just complains about life so that I feel sorry for her and give her money.
My younger sister sucks, I was helping her pay for her college and she was never able to treat me with love and respect, on the contrary, in front of my aunt who raised me, she didn't even greet me.
I'm so angry to think that ever since I left their house, I've been helping them, especially my mother and I've never received love in return, sometimes I couldn't stand the loneliness.
They don't like me, they don't believe in my potential to become a psychologist, they don't care about me, for them I'm the same thing as a mouse.
God will put a good person in my life, who will give all the love I need and when I start my family I will have the support I never had.
I respect animals a lot, I learned that we shouldn't mistreat animals at all.
Then she hugged me and said that we all have our time to live and that no one can know their own.
But miracles exist, I asked her.
Miracles exist because they didn't rebuild Hiroshima from tears, blood, loneliness, now it's a busy port, she told me.
When I told mom she was scared of what I was going to think and wanted to know who told me and I said it was dad.
I told him I had nothing to forgive.
Mom was proud of me and said that I am an angel.
They decided to act as naturally as possible.
But it is inevitable to see the sadness in their eyes.
I heard dad and mom talking yesterday in the bedroom, they said that all medical resources would be at my disposal no matter what the price.
I love them so much because they are taking such good care of me.
In the meantime, I live my sweet life.
And I got tired of worrying about others, always wanting the best for the people around me, and being called boring.
Being nice even to those I should be annoying, trying to treat everyone well.
Two brothers who lived on neighboring farms, separated only by a creek, came into conflict.
What started as a small misunderstanding finally exploded into an exchange of harsh words, followed by weeks of complete silence.
One morning, the older brother heard a knock at his door.
I am looking for work, maybe you have some service for me.
I think I understand the situation, show me where the shovel and nails are.
The older brother delivered the material and went to the city.
The man stayed there cutting, measuring, working all day long.
Instead of a fence, a bridge was built there, connecting the two banks of the creek.
It was a beautiful job.
Looking back at the bridge, he saw his brother approaching with open arms.
You really were a great friend building this bridge even after what I told you, suddenly, in a single impulse, the older brother ran towards the other and they hugged.
The carpenter who did the work left with his toolbox.
Have you ever thought how much easier things would be if we stopped building fences and walls and started building bridges with our family, friends, work colleagues and especially our enemies.
It's so good to love, and to be loved is even better.
I don't feel that love anymore, I don't feel pleasure, I can't even like myself anymore.
Sometimes I think about praying and talking to God.
I have so many sins that I would have to be born twice to ask God for forgiveness and repent of them all.
Even so, I keep making the same mistakes, as if something was pulling me to the bottom of the well, to a dead end, I miss affection, getting ready, going out, having friends to talk to, I miss being someone , to be remembered, to be loved, I feel lost.
The beauty of a woman is in her smile, in her personality, in her simplicity.
The beauty of a woman is within her.
I'm proud of myself, even with all my flaws, problems and quirks, I'm satisfied with myself.
I'm strong, mature, and I learn from my mistakes.
Yeah, I'm proud of myself, because even with all the problems, I'm still here intact.
I'm in love with my best friend.
I just know that I'm better now, and you know what surprised me the most, the fact that those words came from her.
It was God using the mouth of a friend of mine to convey the message that he has something better for me.
Thanks for showing me through Leticia that he wasn't the guy for me, that in the future, something better awaits me.
I was already getting several signs that it wasn't him, but I hadn't realized it, and only now after that, I stopped to look around me and saw that he's not my guy.
I will find someone who really makes me happy, maybe God wants him to be just my friend, my best friend, that kindergarten friend, God has something better for me.
In love with the simple things that the world offers like the forest, the rain, the sun, the moon, the dew of the forest.
I'm like the river that runs in search of something, but doesn't know what, or when it will arrive.
I am always available to help my friends, my true friends and anyone in need.
The graduation of my goddaughter was the most beautiful thing.
Congratulations Camilly Vitória, you went to elementary school, I love you so much goddaughter.
When I sleep at night I always dream of you, you are beautiful.
Despite the distance, there is still hope that I can see you, my eternal love.
But it's only you that makes me feel good.
I don't care about this conversation, I only care about you.
Please explain to me, I never imagined being able to love like this.
Last year I met a boy, we hang out together.
The only one who knows the answer is HE, therefore, reflect on your life and ask forgiveness for your sins, as the Bible teaches, do not judge your neighbor, so as not to be judged.
I have some plans in my mind, and there's a deadline for this to be accomplished.
I ask God to give me patience, because everything is a phase.
I am the only man who will always be faithful to you, the one who will never leave you.
I work miracles, you don't know, but I'm planning your future, and the plans I have for you will make you very happy.
I put it in your life, for you to learn what it is to love, and to know how to value true love, when it arrives.
Because I made your soul mate.
Yeah, the same way you loved her, I do, and I needed her here in heaven.
I made the world, I created love.
And before you were born, I had already written your story.
What happens today, I make up for tomorrow.
Yeah, not me, I'll never leave you, I never get tired of you, I never want you bad, I just want to hug you and see you happy.
I know you like nobody else, your heart is here in my hand, I can feel the beats.
I love you, and I will never let you down.
I've always been very restricted to my masturbation life, let's face it, touching yourself is wonderful, but nobody goes around telling me and I had never mentioned this subject to a friend.
Just like that, I was smiling at life, not wanting anything serious, and he gradually won me over with a nice little chat.
He always made proposals for the hottest video calls and I even got to stay in my bra and panties, but that was a good few months later.
Not to mention that our messages lasted until dawn and always ended in the same subject, sex.
"He told me ""I'm sure we're never going to do these things we talked about, but that's okay""."
I meet him every Saturday, he lives two or three blocks from my condo and we have a few mutual friends.
Well moving on, we always scheduled some movie.
But it was in a week, very well planned by me, that our dream meeting finally took place.
I told my mother that I was going to have ice cream with some imaginary friends, the ice cream parlor is close to his house and a little far from mine, in the initial contract, he had proposed having an ice cream and the second part I had to choose.
Arriving at his house, I felt comfortable.
He and I were studying a subject from his course.
We started kissing, he said cute things.
Then he started trying to play with my intimate area, trying to go over my shorts.
He teased, which hurt a little because of the thick finger, but it was good.
We kissed more and he led me around the corner to my condo.
I'm happy again and I'm laughing a lot at everything that happened.
I wanted to be a connoisseur of life, to understand my heart.
Because it is with him that I breathe, that I dream, and in him that I keep my joys.
Those who love don't forget, those who love don't let it go.
He confides in me that you were the mouth he most liked to kiss.
Well, as my last post was in August, since then a lot of things have happened and all this time without posting anything was because my days were very busy so I'll try to keep a certain frequency here.
September wasn't anything interesting, I worked hard as usual and it was close to the end of the year.
These last 3 months of the month are the period we work the most because we earn by commission.
I mean, I already knew her by sight, we just said Hi.
Then time passed and she would pass in front of the store where I work and we would look at each other.
Until that October, she sent me an invitation on Facebook and I added her.
Then my friend came to tell me that she said I was handsome and asked if I had a girlfriend.
I felt determination on her side, I saw interest, it cheered me up.
Me kinda shy, she came over and gave me a hug and two kisses on the cheek.
Right at that time I felt a good feeling in that warm body and she was very beautiful.
We spent about 20 minutes talking before the movie started and the chat was good, she smiled, touched me, adjusted her blouse and hair, signs of her interest.
Something nice, really nice was kissing for the first time and it felt really good to me.
My desire was to take her breasts, her thigh, kiss her whole body, I was very excited.
She told me that I was a very special guy, that I knew how to treat women like a queen.
But eventually I'll have to learn to live with it.
Because one thing is for sure, if it's not meant to be with you, it's going to be with someone who loves me and reciprocates.
Today is my first day here, I'm loving it!
I fell in love with a boy who is from this site.
And that's how we met and became friends and really were friends with no interests in anything just friends.
We hooked up for seven days and lived a beautiful movie love story. I still remember the 1st kiss facing the sea until we wrote our names on the trailer that was abandoned on the road.
We were together for 4 years and I loved him more than anything, he was the first in my life for everything, I couldn't do anything without him and we were always together.
After that day I changed I innovated my look I changed my wardrobe I finished my studies today I'm a psychologist and I help women like me, if I told you I forgot it wouldn't be true but I can remember everything without pain.
I met a new love we've been together for 3 years and we don't live a beautiful movie story but we love and respect each other we give up a lot to make it work, but we respect our limits and we grow together we're getting married in December.
My mother advised one day that when I had a great love I should fight for it and that's what I did.
Don't let your life pass you by, write your story day after day, you deserve to be happy, you have to be happy, don't give others powers they don't have
I know very well that I'll keep writing and he'll be watching, analyzing what I'm doing.
The other times I came to write, it was to tell funny stories.e
But as everything has its positive side, I believe that this experience will be useful for my next relationships.
I'm here posting this, I don't even know what it's for but let's go.
I woke up with Matheus calling me, then I did something, my mother arrived, I went to the computer, I went to Dani's house and that was it.
Life takes so many turns.
Today I woke up thinking that it was going to be just another day.
But I was also very happy and made a new friend, someone who seemed very special to me and who has a lot to teach me.
We've been dating for 2 months now.
It was his birthday, and I wanted to do something different.
Me, a friend and his family, what a wonderful family, all playful, united, loving.
Between laughs, jokes, it was really cool.
He took me to his room, and there was really good.
It seems like it happened yesterday because I can smell him.
We started with one of those super engaging kisses.
Between kisses, he started caressing me, I was ready to do that, and between kisses I got completely involved.
He caressed me with so much desire, with so much lust.
When penetrating me it was intense, it was pleasurable.
It was wonderful, I felt how he held me while having sex, it was much more enjoyable.
Our union resulted in a beautiful little girl who is my life and is now 4 years old,
We didn't hook up, we didn't even kiss, we had lunch together a few times we spoke on the phone and corresponded through messages and msn, it all started with a friendship.
I spent the whole weekend making a video for my boyfriend for that day, aside from the new set of underwear I bought for today.
Sometimes I get the feeling that animals are slightly more intelligent than we humans are.
We all have a duty to contemplate the light that exists in each one of us.
I'm glad for that, because we were meant to shine.
We are stars, we are our own light.
I keep thinking, what will it be like when I start college, get married, have kids.
But the feeling of someone close by was enough for me.
My life is full of joys and sorrows but I love living my life.
I went to my boyfriend's house today and he had gone to the market.
Therefore, I wish him to be very happy, wherever he goes, that he prospers there.
An old legend of the Sioux Indians tells that, once, Touro Bravo, the bravest and most honorable of all young warriors, and Nuvem Azul, the chief's daughter, one of the most beautiful women of the tribe, arrived hand in hand at the tent of the old sorcerer of the tribe.
We love each other, and we're getting married.
And the old man moved to see them so young, so in love and so eager for a word.
The young ones embraced tenderly, and soon left to fulfill the recommended mission.
On the established day, in front of the sorcerer's tent, the two waited with the birds in a bag.
The old man asked them to carefully take them out of the bags and saw that they were truly beautiful specimens.
I figured the best way to express myself, tell my wins and losses, the right and wrong things I've done, had to be on the computer.
I keep thinking I need to go to a psychologist, because I know I can trust him because he keeps all that with him to have an income.
The love I feel for you is unconditional.
Of perfect nights of love, you made me see what love really is.
Always loved me when I needed it most, always supported me.
Luckily HE (boyfriend) called me, time went by very quickly, we talked a lot, we're fine now.
I tried to sleep on the porch, it was so nice, you know, looking at the moon.
And he calms me down, and now everything is getting better.
The Lord knows and searches my heart, he knows what I think, what I feel.
You know how much I love Diego, and that I would never do anything bad to him.
And I engrave this, God bless my mother-in-law, give her peace.
I like dear diary, it's a very cool site, people express their feelings.
I'm 15 years old and I live in Rio and what I like most is being on the internet.
The medicine works, but the problem is that it has more than strong side effects.
But that didn't stop me from getting a 10 on the math test which, let's face it, was super easy.
Doing equations is really cool.
Carol and I are becoming more and more friends, I love her.
Ju and Geovana became less bossy, which improved our relationship.
I think I'm going to do a perm and release the curls that exist inside me!
I've always been in love with curls, but I don't know why, I straightened my hair.
Tomorrow I'm going to buy my dress, but I don't know if it's going to be the one I said, because in addition to the dress, I still have to buy a pair of heels and a present.
It doesn't matter the price, what matters is that I look beautiful on the day.
I don't consider it a bad feeling, because it makes me hope in the midst of so much fighting.
He was my 3rd year Geography teacher, but he taught from August to December.
I kept watching him teach, dreaming, imagining things.
He started talking to me and stopped calling me by my name and started calling me by my nickname.
He was super sweet to me on msn and that arouse this platonic love in me even more.
I just didn't try anything with him, because he's engaged.
Platonic love that fills my soul.
I need good band Aids that are not eternal, after all nothing is forever, but that are not disposable.
Fellow and sincere healers, who really care about you.
I need you to love yourself too and promise that you will try to take care of me more, I am part of you.
Today I went to the school library, at Physical Education class time, and picked up a book.
I trusted Evellyn (my cousin) a lot, I told her things that only I should know, I told her my secrets, I did things with her, I trusted her until the last moment.
Tonight I start my book and I want to share it with you and, of course, ask for those usual famous criticisms, I need that critical eye that every good reader has.
Thank you all in advance and I wish you a great night!
When a breeze caresses your skin, it will be my sigh to pass.
When the sea water calms you down, it will be my embrace that you will feel.
When a petal touches your face, it will be my hand sliding down your body.
When you feel the sweet taste of a drink, it will be my kiss that warms you up.
When the blood drains from your body, it will be my love going with you.
And when you finally cross the road, you'll see the path that awaits you and your great love waiting for you.
I really don't regret anything, having sex with him because he made it worthwhile, he made me feel like never before, he did crazy things in bed with me.
Yesterday I went to a spiritist center for the first time, it was recommended by Letícia, a friend of mine who now lives in João Pessoa.
"I believe in those ""things"", it may seem silly to some people, but to me it's not."
I was here at home with a group of friends looking at some music on the internet, just us, my parents and my brother had gone out, I went to my room to get something.
My friend Luana took me to an evangelical service so that the pastor could talk to me, I called my boyfriend at the time to go with me.
Everything was normal, I was anxious to see him, I went to his house after work, I took a shower and we went to bed.
We did everything a couple normally does, we flirted, we played, we laughed, and we played in a different way, we looked at each other, we smiled, we kissed and we smiled again.
We talked about a future, more present in us, marriage, about seeing some houses, imagining ourselves together forever, in our house, with our things our way and him imagining me pregnant!
"In the end , we said goodbye , and we looked at each other as if our eyes were exchanging an "" I love you "" and I feel like that was it !"
When you meet someone and that someone makes your heart stop working for a few seconds, pay attention: they may be the most important person in your life.
I'm creating this page to vent to my own computer.
At that moment I am busy with the tasks that the day demands of me, without inconveniences out of turn.
I also bought pumpkin and went to the cashier.
In front of me there was that woman, who unbelievably no longer carried the same pumpkin, but half of it.
On this Valentine's Day I really thought I was going to spend it with someone!
And I get lost thinking about his smile, how beautiful he is, how he made me feel so special in a matter of minutes.
Marcelo is special and what I feel for him has not ended, it has only grown more and more.
He was always by my side and what I wanted most is for him to be by my side every day.
Passion is just a moment thing and liking is different from loving.
I entered this forum and saw super nice and smart people.
While you are important to people, you are beautiful, you are cute, you are smart, you are sensual and if you go beyond everything you become love.
Being smart is the right thing for you
No one when they really love can forget this feeling that is above all, this feeling is true love.
Above all, guard your heart, for the waters of life flow from it.
It's better to be alone, because while you're alone, you watch over your heart, somewhere, someone also thinks the same as you and one day you'll meet.
Just look at those elderly couples who have been together for so many years and are still together until death do them apart!
What you sow you will surely reap.
When I was a kid, I believed that the stars were the eyes of God, that they blinked at you every now and then just to let you know there was a guy up there watching out for the shenanigans we were up to.
When I was a child, I watched the cartoons of Speedy Gonzalez and I was delighted to see those Mexican beans that jumped by themselves.
I will report here my very first experience in 2013.
It was a delight, you see, making love in the car is very pleasant, and better when we least expect it.
It all started like this, I went to visit a friend of mine who called me earlier saying that she wanted to see me, however, when I arrived in front of her house, I saw that everything was closed, that is, she was not at home or was already sleeping.
That's when I met a woman I had met before and I stopped the car, it's like an American movie, where the heartthrob stops and the woman gets in the car and that's how it was.
We had hooked up before and it was really crazy, she had already sucked me until I came in her mouth.
I stopped in the parking lot of a street market in the Santo Antônio neighborhood in Manaus and there we began to make out passionately.
She immediately ran to my legs and began to take my penis very masterfully.
I said I missed it and she said she missed it too.
This was my New Year's sex report.
I cut my hair, dyed it, cut it, changed my clothes, my makeup, my tastes.
I threw out the furniture, the posters, the color, I threw away everything I didn't need.
Material things can be thrown away.
And you deserve better love, you deserve better, a better guy.
A place with peace, with joy.
Like the playful big brother, like the most amazing duck hunter that ever walked the earth.
Owner of the most beautiful smile, the bluest eyes on the planet.
It's believing in a better world.
I continue to love watching cartoons, preferring to spend all night on the computer and not caring about what others will say or think about me.
My name is Marcelo, I'm 16 years old, I'll be 17 at the end of the year, I'm very nice, sweet and I always try to be funny, I like to see people happy.
I'm fascinated by aliens, like, I'm crazy about them, I believe in aliens and I've seen a UFO a few months ago.
I feel safe around him, he's so cute and he makes me feel really good, I love holding his hair, I love holding his hand and watching him draw.
He draws so well and his smile is beautiful.
I just know that yesterday I dreamed about him and when I'm with him I forget everything around me.
His friends have already noticed that I'm liking him too much.
Never give up on your choices and your dreams!
Put your problems in the hands of the Lord, and He will give you Victories!
Have a winning life.
Tall girl, mulatto, very pretty.
As soon as I arrived, Penelope was waiting.
We left the waiting room and entered a long corridor.
We arrived at our corner: a stretcher surrounded by curtains.
And then Penelope applied the first layer of hot wax to my virgin crotch.
Yummy, warm, pleasant.
I woke up with the illusion of going to a party and drinking like every 17-year-old teenager.
I went to get ready at a friend's house and I was going to drink at my best friend's house.
We thank you more and more for the suggestions sent and we are working towards an even better diary!
Today, my first post, it's going to be pretty quick because it's late.
I've been researching the age of the people here, and as I said I'm writing a book, I've already posted the first chapter of it.
I'm used to being away for days.
I hope time passes, I hope the week ends, so I can see you again!
This movie teaches you how to love and respect the person you love.
I saw and fell even more in love with my husband and my marriage.
True friends are angels!
I discovered this irrefutable truth when I realized how rare these gems are that suddenly arrive in people's lives and lodge slowly in a special and essential place of our existence.
Over the years, we have encountered various types of angels.
Some are light and fun, they show us the joy of life.
Some bump into us on a street corner without warning and give us real caresses, real smiles, real protection.
The important thing is that we try, throughout our lives, to always have an angel we can count on in difficult times to give us encouragement.
I have noticed how my life has changed over the years and how I have changed.
I am selective in my friendships.
Everything that is different bothers what is the same.
Today my mother gave me a scapular, and it has a message from God in one of the squares.
I am currently in a homosexual relationship.
Today I started the day talking to Gabriel, the youngest here at the new project in which I am one of those responsible.
But he's handsome, that smile, the way he talks to me is so sweet.
"I sent an email to my ""colleague"" last Wednesday, saying that if he was available I needed to talk."
I don't want you to judge me, curse me or anything like that, I just want you to understand me!
