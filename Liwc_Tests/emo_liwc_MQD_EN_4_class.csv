hi dear diary here i am again feeling like shit and it s all my fault ,-1
it s worderful to know that each day we re bonding more and more,0
in life we must count with the support from the person that we chose to spend all our moments with ,1
i m very happy and i hope you are too ,1
we ordered pizza to celebrate and i wrote a letter and put in his side of the bed ,0
we have the basic ingredient that holds everything together that just a few have the privilege to have love ,1
a toast to our existence and to our future ,0
today a war ends ,-1
a battle doesn t end the war will go on the war is to destroy the chains that holds me from my aspirations that separates me from my dreams ,-1
i m too tall and skinny i don t have a body and i suffer because of it ,-1
here is the deal i m 13 already and i almost don t have a body the girls from my class are already formed and here i am with my thin thighs,0
picture a tall 14 year old with no boobs no ass long and thin thighs certainly would look like shit,0
i m already a lady so i notice when boys look to girls with big boobs and ass almost anyone looks at me and this is very boring ,-1
when everything feels like it s gonna fall apart i feel like broken in pieces ,0
all i want is to be alone turn my room s light off and wait for time to pass hoping that the pain goes away ,-1
time always helps but sometimes one minute alone in this dark room fells like so much more time ,0
i feel week to fight for all the things that i want and people always letting us down ,-1
trust in yourself is the best solution to find yourself out of this type of situation ,1
try to stay strong and believe then everything will pass ,1
i love the way you look at me with so much tenderness live everything about me was exclusive ,1
i love your sincerity and inocence ,1
you make me feel good and i fell like i m truly loved ,1
i can t stand listen to this outrage anymore throwing at my face the things that he did for me that s why i chose to be a prostitute ,-1
i wrote this story by order of my son s father ,0
he insisted that i wrote exactly how our romance were since the beggining without hiding anything and published on the internet after ,1
i m married happly married with a good job where i met someone ,1
you know that person that you connect instantly have lunch every day and end s up beeing friends with ,0
since we had lunch together almost every day we knew a lot about each other s lifes i knew about his girlfriends and he a little bit about me ,0
i started to get rides with him after work fact that i thought it was better to hide from my husband since he thinks that i take the bus home but the bus is so full of people and it takes forever ,1
one day the traffic was terrible because of floods in the city so he suggested that we stopped in a small street to wait for the traffic get better luckly the car has dark windows witch gives more security ,0
he talked looking at me with his hand on the back of my seat and strangely i started to feel good with him there ,1
i started to feel a strange internal excitement not particullarly about him but about the situation ,0
after all for me that always lived like a faithful wife everything was news and news attracts women ,1
he slipt his hands to my neck i could fell his breath ,0
i had goosebumps he noticed and got closer and held my face he went putting his face closer and closer until his lips touched mine ,0
i didn t know what to do ,0
i was surprised and paralized ,1
i felt a shock and my body burning up about this unexpected situation ,-1
7me already weezing,0
we ended up kissing more and more and my arms were envolving him ,1
i confess that our situation was giving me a pleasure almost unknown it was a delicious feeling our tonges touching while he squeezed mt breasts ,1
he insinuated that i could be pregnant i said no way because i was on the pills ,0
i wished so much the things went differently but unfortunately you sir changed the path of our lives forever ,-1
you didn t left anything for my future you forgot about me like i never existed ,0
but it s ok now i realized that i ve never needed you for anything because even when i missed you i cried ,-1
i started to not miss you not cry for you because the love of my mother fullfill me and drowned all my pain ,-1
we must never forget that we are the architects of our own destiny each one was their free will to follow their lifes as it wishes ,1
i hope you to be very happy with a calm elderness and also to be healthy to take care of your kids when they need you ,1
i can t take this with me anymore ,0
it s very sad to know that i have a sister that made me date a gay boy simply to stifle his romance with my 15 year old nephew,0
it s even sadder to know that she pushed me to loose my virginity with him supported my relationship and let me envolve util i fell in love with him ,1
i m tired of fighting with my mom she s never on my side ,-1
o pior de tudo foi q ele terminou comigo alegando que eu n o podia ficar ate as 4 da manha na rua the worsrt of all he was the one breaking up saying that i coudn t be on the street until 4 am,0
the moon is so beautiful tonight so perfect a masterpiece by god ,1
i ve always liked admiring the sky looking at the stars trying to understand the mystery from up there and when i look at the moon oh the moon ,1
she reminds me of so much beautiful things it s like she was accomplice to lovers to those in love and sometimes i stop to watch her and feel a wonderful peace ,1
thank you god for all of the things you made for me ,1
i love you so much dad ,1
my boyfriend has zero style can you help me ,0
so i always go out with my boyfriend well dressed smelling good and with makeup on i ve never made him embarrassed anywhere we went to ,1
some people even look at us and won t believe we are together ,1
today i was going to work with a flowered strapless dress with a pair of very high heels a lace vest makeup matching the outfit with pearl earrings and a rayban ,0
and my boyfriend was wearing jeans shorts a polo shirt and oakley shoes with a dirty ragged and with no shoelace left foot ,0
it s desgusting then i took the company s bus and when i entered he undressed one sleeve of the shirt you know and was about to take off the rest of the shirt ,0
 what a embarrassment i went through in the bus he had a chav behavior ,-1
 i bought him a v neck shirt with zipers ,0
today is my birthday ,0
 i already started the day badly ,-1
 my mom remembered a few people remembered ,0
and my dad for sure won t remember ,1
 i don t know each day i wish less and less being here ,0
last year everything was too perfect and this year not even a little bit ,1
the one i was most expecting to remember didn t ,0
 i just wan t this day to be over soon ,0
i arrived from school feeling normal had lunch and i was with the earphones in the last volume ,0
my 4 year old cousin was in the living room talking with my mom so i just finished and went to the living room,0
it s really that hard for her to love me because she said that i won t make a difference the only thing i wanted was to be friends with my mom but she stops me from it ,1
i don t think i will pass to the itb let to the fieb ,0
on the itb exam i think i got 35 of 50,0
i ve never regreted that much i doubt that i can pass with this score to enter in the buildings technician course you must score at least 40,-1
i m definetly not among the 24 people with the highest scores,0
i m gonna be dying in embarrassment when the scores go public ,-1
everyone keeps talking that i m already in but they don t realize that i chose the most competitive course ,0
i m very sad i shoud have listened to my math teacher and i also chose an average prep course ,-1
on the fieb i have even less chance ,0
everyone keeps saying that i m gonna pass but i know i m not going to ,0
on wednesday s night the scores go public then i will want to know how many i got right ,0
on the 22 at night the list with the approved go public on the 28 th the second list drops and after if there s any the remaining spots will go public in the remanescent list,1
but i don t think i ll be even in the remanescent s list ,0
it was a lot of people i m sure that the 24 candidates approved will be getting the highest score possible,1
that s not because it feels to live shouting your qualities ,0
prefers the privacy staying quiet watching and taking your own conclusions ,0
people care too little with other s opinion ,1
it has a big sensuality and knows how to explore it very well ,1
it tends to be jealous and possessive whitch is a big flaw ,-1
it would be good to be cautious about some habits ,1
i ve been thinking a lot about all the things you said to me today ,0
my insomnia hitted a critical level and i finally went to se a psychiatrist to see what he could do ,-1
i got in there decided that i ll only leave with some other medicine besides the antidepressant ,0
she prescribed me zolpidem an hypnotic to help me sleep ,0
besides the fact that it is a red label medicine i ll not be able to use it for more than two months because of the addiction ,0
i ve spent a good amount of time thinking about if i would take it or not like it was some kind of poison ,1
me and my fear of taking new medicine i was scared to have some kind of collateral reaction ,-1
but it was fine i layed down and slept like a baby by the two times i ve take it ,1
and when i wake up i don t spend the whole day like a loser ,-1
i wake up with a lot more energy ,1
i ve loved the medicine until now ,1
last week i had sex with my boyfriend on his house ,0
he as i predict didn t had a condom and i refused to do it like that ,0
so he said that we could do it on another day ,0
i insisted and i went to buy a condom in the pharmacy ,0
i was a little embarrassed but it was worth it ,-1
we have our little fights from time to time but i love him ,0
i don t know it s a weird relationship ,-1
i change my feelings towards him a lot ,0
sometimes it s like i don t feel nothing for him when we fight ,-1
but there s times when it feels like i m gonna explode with so much love ,1
and he notices this that i get colder with the tiniest of fights ,-1
about the ocd symptoms they stay very annoying ,-1
the thought i want to kill myself it s current ,-1
and i even start hurting me again a little despite i ve never really stopped ,-1
i shout dozens of times during the day ,0
my compulsion for candy continues it gives me some momentary relief ,1
i thought even in smelling glue that actually was the most symbolic thing about my despire and i knew that it was not going to help in anything ,0
it was one of those tstyrofoam glues and it was already dry ,0
despite of all those things sometimes i forget about everything i m going through and feel so good ,1
the antidepressant has his take on it but it s not just him ,0
i don t think that my life is a disgrace despite the ocd low self esteem anxiety insomnia panic and family issues ,-1
by the way my college classes starts on monday ,0
the classes are a little boring but at least the amount of hours is short ,-1
the majority of the classes are in the morning so i m gonna have to wake up early ,0
on the other hand it s going to be good because i m not gonna have to listen to my mom shouting at traffic whitch helps a lot ,1
today close to turn 30 i decided to end my fattiness and lift my self esteem,0
tenho a estatura de 1 57 cm e 60 kg i have the size of 1 57cm and 60 kg,0
i m already on the limit to be overweight ,0
dear diary i ve missed you i wasn t writing that much here because my vacations were beeing the biggest boredom ever and i didn t have that much to write about but now my classes are back and i ll go back writing ,-1
well my first day of school already began with two new teachers ,1
on first period ricardo with math and geometry and on second period kairton with grammar interpretation and writing ,0
on ricardo s class we revisited some things from last year and he gave an assignment i liked him he is funny ,1
on kairton s class we revisited too but the part that i liked the most was when we analyzed the music ,1
we went to analyze a song called pais e filhos by legi o urbana i really love this song ,1
i ve listened to all of it and was very proud of myself ,1
great he already knows my name that boring girl aline was dying in envy i m liking the new teachers specially kairton ,0
no now you are great ,1
well i saw him he saw me but he doesn t spoke to me ,1
i m not talking about santa maria s tragedy because only thinking about it makes me want to cry well i m finishing now after school i drop by to tell more about it ,-1
it looks like i always follow the harder path i m tired of all beeing so dramatic ,0
my world my issues ,0
seen you going out could be another one of them but it s not what s going on ,0
i think about you all the time and my heart hurts when i imagine what you are doing ,-1
all the moments i m losing with you ,-1
i feel week and sufocated by my own heart ,0
i think he prefers you and not my reason ,0
without you i feel without wings uncapable to fly ,0
a friend of mine already knew that i liked my friend ,1
today at holiday s eve she was by coincidence at the same group that him and asked him if he liked me but he said that only as a friend ,1
but she started saying that i liked him and at the end praised the green eyes ,1
this boy is not arrogant at all he s actually super nice and from some time now i fell in love with him,1
he s gonna probably will speak with me through facebook ,0
is he going to start analyzing me ,0
i particularly will not care if he say that want s me only as a friend i m good i just don t want that he treats me worst ,1
especially with everything that s happening it s making me closer to him ,0
guys i have 13 years old and haven t kissed anyone in my entire life,1
and the worst of all is that i never really talked much with boys and i don t consider myself a good looking person ,0
i was a very shy kid i remember that my class used to be very noisy while i standed by the corner alone without talking to anyone ,-1
it has always been very difficult for me to get along with people ,-1
the mizerable life of paulo anderson ,0
how many sadness and disapointments i ve been through in life right thank god that i write only for myself because i m the only one who knows what i ve been through i ve never wanted to share my shitty life with anyone ,0
my life is an internal and eternal suffering ,-1
i ve never starved nor had a disease i thank god for having my two eyes ,1
me refugiei dentro da umbanda com meus guias e guias dos outros i found refugee in umbanda with my guides and other s guides ,0
it was so difficult so many mysteries so many questions withou answers ,-1
i ve lost track of how many different ways i ve tried to find the truth ,0
wrong cult places wrong guides rudeness with people responsability lack of action unfortune lack of going out home lack of working hard excessive handjobs cards tarot opening jobs ,-1
how many motives i thought were the reason for my suffering i haven t found the answer until today ,-1
today with 21 years old like it was a blessing from the sky i started to see depositions of people that were healed by therapy from other past lifes,1
symptoms that i ve always struggled with like shyness depression isolation poor oriented spiritual guideness family fights lack of affection and carreer i ve tried to reach some kind of autoregression but haven t found it ,-1
so i decided to google a clinic that does past life therapy in goi nia before that i didn t even know it existed here i had seen it just on tv ,0
i found the blog of crisanne braga a great holistic therapist from town i read some things from her blog and got in touch wanting to know the prices ,1
today was my first session the therapist gave me a good impression ,1
we talked and right away i got familiar with her i thought i woudn t have the courage to tell my problems to a stranger but i managed to talk about everything with her ,0
during a moment of relaxation and laughs i had a very weird moment felt a spirit near me and suddenly i had a sensation that i ve already been there in that clinic before ,1
every time my brother in law gets home he manages to be alone with me ,-1
today since it s raining i stayed in bed then he came softly and sat next to me until then it was fine ,1
but then he started to look away from tv and back at me i pretended i did t see and kept focused on tv ,0
he then started putting his hand inside the blanket to try to touch me ,0
of course i didn t let him i hate it could it be that my sister does t see that he is not worth it ,-1
then i got up and went outside didn t took that long he came after me kept asking until what time i was working ,0
i said i was working until late ,0
and it s not the first time que tries something i don t want to go into details ,0
i ll be rooting for him to stay far away from me also because he is not pretty at all ,1
well first of all i should drop here that she sent the email below telling everything piece by piece and i assure that is 100 true,1
arriving at the factory i did the usual but when i m entering my office i hear the phone ring and when i see the name on the screen my heart races i get it and we set to see each other at the end of the day ,0
by lunch he calls me and say that is very horny my body burns like something in me is triggered by his voice,0
i confirmed and waited for the hour ,0
the whole bus stoped and asked me if i was going to benq i said no ,0
they went i entered the office i was by the computer when i put my purse and a bag on a desk close to his he kissed me with such a desire we started the act there ,1
we left the factory and went to a place near with low stars but doable in the room the furniture was not very pretty but since we were into each other we started but i asked to clean myself because i handle with oil grease etc ,0
i felt very dirty so i entered the water washed my body passed my hand on the soap that was at my desk because i had bought it to meet his mother ,0
i m here to share my sad life more specifically my sad life as a cocaine addicted ,-1
it s been about 5 years that i suffer with this evil i ve lost a lot and continue losing each day today was one of those days when i think about suicide but again i ve decided to stay trying,-1
i m lonely besides beein married it s been some time that this marriage is just a signed paper the love respect and trust are gone what s left is the self indulgence sadness and lack of hope by my wife ,1
i ve done and suffered things that makes me feel like crap i ve passed by situations that you can t even wish to your worst enemy i m not going to give details about today but i ll talk about it over time ,-1
i m alone my wife spend the whole day out and said that was at her mother s i say that she said because i fear beeing cheated for some time now ,-1
i ve hurted my wife of so many ways that i don t have at least the courage to call her even thinking that she could be at a motel with someone ,0
i don t have the courage to call for fidelity and that for a man is the great of all shames i m not a man i m not a person i m a nothing with the drugs ,1
i m here feeling the taste of the drug that still drips by my throat from my nose i m depressed almost desperate and with a tremendous sadness ,-1
i know that the excess of sadness are the drugs talking i know that this chemical sadness will pass but the real sadness from the life that i take this one walks with me every day ,-1
i don t know what to say don t know what to do i m lost i ve asked for help even to my dog in a psychotic hope that he could answer me or would do something magical ,0
i just don t have anyone to count on don t have a mother neither family caused by issues i had with my mom that s always been violent and sick ,-1
always loose control and used a demonic evilness on the spanks that she gave me ,0
my dad never was a true father figure ofuscated by my mother s strenght ,1
my sister i don t have anything with her she doesn t even exists to me my brother i feel pity but he lives well besides everything ,0
it s midnight now i m going to watch some miniseries trick myself with the hope of happy endings that always exists in them and wait that one day i have a happy ending myself ,1
now it s 00 03 i m depressed alone and unsure about my future,-1
but i ll keep fighting i fight since the day i gave up of killing myself throwing me out of the roof by a bamboo stick at two in the morning of a starred night ,-1
well this is my first text so i ll introduce mysel my name is kevin i live in pe ,1
since last night my mother don t even look at my face neither talks to me ,0
today i woke up and she doesn t even looked at me ,0
she has the habit to say things and after confess to my face that didn t do it ,0
like last week i did her hair because i do a hair stylist course so i have to practice but obviously blowing hair straight and using the flat iron i can do very well ,1
so i did her hair i blowed her hair outside to match the haircut and she said it was terrible and asked to redo everything but to the inside ,-1
last week she asked me to do her hair again so i did it to the outside of course ,0
then she said that it was horrible that i didn t know how to do anything right that my course don t worth nothing and that other people do it better than me ,0
that hurted me it would hurt anyone right ,-1
so today were in the room me my dad and my mom my mom said that i never done anything for her never had the good will to give opinions about her hair ,1
then i told my dad what he said to me that day he said it is not true that i am a liar and he didn t say any of that ,0
dude seriously this pisses me off with her ,-1
why do you lie like that ,0
and it was not the first time she always lies ,-1
she tells me thing and after say that haven t done it calls me a liar ,-1
i like her a lot and i know that she loves me ,1
my grandmother passed away i don t know how to deal with this situation ,0
i m afraid of being depressed again my heart is in a huge void i try everything to keep my mind busy passing time and nothing gives me comfort nothing takes the image of her last breath off my mind ,-1
i love you grandma stay caring for me from whatever you are thank you for beeing the amazing grandmother that you were for me for every gesture of love and smile ,1
you were and will always be my warrior you didn t loose for cancer cancer lost for you my warrior ,-1
you used to make jokes made us smile and every time someone said how s it going miss maria ,1
you always answered i m good thanks to god and what a strong women you were i love you so much ,1
what a great pain is missing you every day when i woke up i grab the phone wanting to call you to know how are you but i sill think that i coudn t process all of this ,-1
i love you and every gesture of yours is going to be inside my heart to remember of your love for us i love you ,1
 i m gonna miss you you are a piece of me that will be greatly missed,-1
why i feel so bad and negative ,-1
i went to the doctor and he said that all of this pain that i m feeling are caused by stress how can i be calm ,-1
not all of it went that wrong like it s going now but i still believe that this year is going to be good ,0
 dude i cry sometimes without realizing it and bite my mouth so that i won t break out in front of some people ,0
hearing thrash by my father and seeing my mother proposing ridiculous things makes me get worse more nervous ,-1
more useless pain not a pain that helps me to grow or age ,-1
i just want my life back and to all of this to end ,0
my immune system can t take it anymore ,0
i went to the gym very good today like i ve promissed ,1
today was fill with people and this sucks takes too long ,-1
i met a new girl there i think we will be friends ,0
but something funny happened actually since the first day ,1
it s my instructor it s like he is always hitting on me from my arrival until i leave ,0
on the other times it was like that too but now is too much ,0
and i m a person that don t notice when someone has interest in me but in this case i m not sure about that ,1
today i arrived there at seven in the morning he was all smiley said the things i had to do and exercise by exercise he went to me saying something ,1
on the last exercise he stayed by my side and i said that i was tired he responded if you want to you can stay until 10pm we can close the gym together,0
when i was leaving he gave me a chocolate ,0
 the worst part is that he is the only there the moment i m arriving and i feel awkward with that right ,-1
but i didn t call him off even because he never asked anything to me just treat me like that flattering me ,1
i m having dinner staying with the prettiest boy in the world ,1
so today me and my friends had the idea of doing the pen game ,0
maybe the way that me and my friends did it is wrong but it seems to be real ,-1
well my name is daniele felix i m 15 years old and i don t have anyone to talk to so i chose here,1
i m upset with everything that s happening to me ,-1
some months ago i ran by a friend he started to give me some attention and i was believing in him he said so many beautiful things ,1
i got really sad because i liked him very much and i was willing to do everything for him then my tears fell without any control so i told my friend and she s helping me a lot ,0
but he lefted me as a second choice ,0
i went to a barbecue at a friends place and met her carol was her name after i found out that was jessica but it s ok ,1
i hooked up with her and we went to a motel on this day i played with her saying that she was going to fall in love with me ,1
i admit that i really liked to hook up with her it was great but i took off though she would t want to see me again ,1
after some time we ended up seeing each other more and hooked up more times ,0
but there was something in her that bothered me a lot her way to see life it was vulgar she thought only about parties going out for drinks like this was in first place on her goals ,0
but now before ended up things i m feeling weird i think i ended up liking her her way to take care of me her wanting my presence her way to be jealous her saying that she miss me her not mind spending her job breaks locked up in a room talking to be honest i m going to miss her ,-1
 at this moment i m avoiding her and it s heart breaking but i have to do this it can t go on and i m really jelous and intolerant with this kind of stuff there s not even a chance of me and her working ,0
 i m going to miss her but that s life sometimes we have to let something go to continue our path ,-1
lately i ve been very compulsive for masturbation with the vibrator for food kinda agressive shaking me biting me scratching me ,-1
it was not really a hookup but it was nice ,1
and we had sex two more times in a motel i did t have an orgasm to be honest my vibrator gives me more pleasure but anyway everything that gives me pleasure i m there ,1
in the last psychiatric appointment he wanted to give me a neuroleptic i refused right away fatten up i m out and at the comeback he suggested a mood stabilizer ,0
he kinda suggested i have a borderline personality and bipolar spectrum cyclothymia anyway nothing i didn t already suspect ,0
i didn t accepted the stabilizer for the same reason of the risperidone ,1
i m so fat i look like a whale i don t want to get fatter and that s it ,0
then he thought it was better to put me on just a pill of fluoxetine ,1
of course that having hypomanic crisis it s kinda embarrassing but getting depressed and with suicidal ideations it s also not cool at all ,-1
i ve been really stressed lately ,-1
i had a fight with my mom because she didn t want to land me the notebook for me to do the assigment and i burned myself with a candle ,-1
i won a new notebook ,1
i had a crying crisis while having sex with my boyfriend accusing him of not loving me treating me like an object and for him not to touch me anymore ,0
 he wanted to have anal sex in me and was insisting a lot ,0
okay i overreacted it didn t have to be like this ,1
later he said that i appreciated and depreciated him very quickly that i m constantly changing my mood one moment i m sad and the other i m super happy and he asked me if i had any personality or mood disorder ,1
i m writing disconnected words because my mind is disconnected ,0
my thought is confused and messy ,-1
yes this makes me embarrased i like to be in control ,0
i m the boss when i m having sex ,0
i stay on top of him ride him and say that i paid this fucking motel for an hour and a half so i want to have sex for an hour and a half ,-1
finally on vacation ,0
well my psychiatrist wanted me to try to stay on only one pill of fluoxitine ,1
it didn t even complete two weeks and i could t take anymore and asked to comeback to the previous dosage two pills ,0
i was the entire time like i want to kill myself kill myself wasn t sleeping anguish and screaming anxiety crying for every little thing ,-1
lately me sex and agressive instincts are very flourished ,0
i think i m addicted to watching porn on internet ,0
 well i can t take this anxiety anymore ,0
i got particularly atractted to sadomasochistic scenes ,0
at the same time they make me feel good at the same time they make me feel bad ,0
i start remembering my agressions and humiliations and i feel bad ,-1
i don t know it s such a weird thing ,-1
and i feel like some kind of whore too just like them who am i to call someone a whore anyway ,-1
and the screams are so forced it looks more like someone is givin birth than having sex not having sex copulating ,-1
but anyway sex is sex and that makes me relaxed ,1
i don t want to be like a whale i m already too fat ,0
 at least porn doesn t fatten ,0
i can t stand being away from my boyfriend anymore fuck i want to have sex ,-1
she traveled and i m here dry ,0
now she s with that thing of controlling me ,0
i had another a mood changing episode in front of him and he threatened to break up if i didn t take the mood stabilizer ,-1
well i ve been searching and the nicest that i found was the lamotrigine it doesn t fatten ,1
topiramate makes you lose weight but fucks up your memory and for an university girl this is not cool at all ,-1
well i m not sure if i m gonna take it ,1
i m afraid of turning myself into a robot ,-1
today my class went to the library after the break ,0
today at break time i was looking up some books to see which one i would pick i didn t find any book interesting ,1
there was a book there biloca s diary it s really small and short ,0
it doesn t have a lot of pages and the writter is also unknown to me ,0
i got it thinking it was one of that childish books that say dear diary today i learned how to read ,1
biluca is not a very known name,0
so there wasn t even time to read the book s whole page and it already hit ,0
i went to class and a little after my teacher took us to the library ,0
i rented a book and left ,0
 when the librarian gave me the book i almost died of embarrasment for picking that book ,0
but it turned out i read it and got very intested in it ,0
i already read half of the book and i can see it s compleatly differant then i thought,0
it s about an almost teenager almost because she s still growing and everything my god ,0
the discovery of new feelings new actions and things like that ,0
when i read the rest of the book i won t waste the chance to make a summary ,1
mom i m sorry for me being who i am for being so and purely me for being diferent for being so wrong in your eyes ,-1
i m sorry or better forgive me for not being the daughter of your perfect dreams for desapointing you when you expected the best from me ,1
but for me is so hard to please you ,1
on the contrary i love you very much ,1
 i love you more then i love myself after all you re my mom ,1
hate i don t have for you not even for my father despite of him being absent ,-1
hate i have of myself for not being the daughter that you ve always wanted and wished and even though i try yes i try ,-1
i m sorry for not growing up the way and how you expected ,-1
but you don t know how it hurts when you disapprove everything i do for you ,-1
you don t know how it hurts me when you put me down and humiliate me in front of whatever it is ,-1
i just wanted to be a reason to be proud but i think i ll never be good enought for you and i can t fake that is all good anymore because it is not ,1
i m sorry i ll never be perfect and that believe me or not hurts more in me than you ,-1
i can t stand out fights anymore they let me in a state that i can t even explain in words ,-1
and nothing will change the things you said to me nothing is going to make us get along again ,0
but mom please don t let go of me like this ,1
 i can t believe is so hard to talk to you my own mother ,0
yesterday sunday i could t write in here because i was really busy ,0
on saturday i went to my cousin s bridal shower who s getting married soon ,0
me my sister my boyfriend dad and mom went ,0
 my boyfriend slept in my house ,0
 i share the bedroom with my sister so i slept on my bed he on the mattress on the floor by my side and my sister on her bed which is righ next to it very close ,1
 we got home from the party and went straight to bed my sister was the first to fell asleep while me and my boyfriend were holding hands he was lying down and so was i and talking very softly ,0
until suddenly my sister gets up and starts to cry like a crazy person ,-1
 at the end turned out she went to bed with my dad and my mom on her bed my sister s ,0
my mom is super cool she looks like a teenager with a woman s mind she s always in a good mood when we go to parties she dances shake and cheer everybody up ,1
her relationship with my boyfriend is great they tell jokes and i love that ,1
then he hugged me kissed me and passing time a little and later we slept ,1
i feel too much cold when i was in bed i took 3 blankets and was wearing a sweatshirt,0
it was just him hug me that i also started to feel warmer and took off my sweatshirt ,1
when i woke up my boyfriend was with his hands on my waist hugging me and with his head closer to my hair ,1
he says that he woke up before me and was kissing my face and i don t even moved from so much sleep ,1
we got up and went to by some beer to my mother ,0
after some time we layed down on the sofa it was late already because he wanted to see the game that was going to broadcast on the tv,0
when i woke up he hugged me kissed me calling me lazy and said i love you he is too beautiful ,1
we stayed the rest of the day cuddling we planned to go to the mall so he could pay a bill but who said that the laziness let us ,0
so that s it i stay here today i m very happy and i miss him already we are sticky in our own way ,0
it s very good to have a person that you love by your side ,1
besides waking up with an i love you makes your day wonderfull and happy ,1
well good night i just wanted to thank you for the previous subject comments ,1
well everything started in april from last year when my mom started to date a man that i don t even know where it came from they were dating for a week and he was already living inside my house ,1
on the day of his birthday i saw him hiding drugs inside my room so i went and tell it to my mom ,0
they fought and she broke up with him ,-1
but at 5am i woke up with my mom screaming for help he went inside the house and was trying to kill her,-1
like it wasn t enough the fact of having a criminal inside the house he wouldn t let her spoke to me he was around her all the time ,0
in that song he start to say some thing about love and i think that all he is saying is beautiful ,1
a feeling of failure took over me sadness discouragement and a full lack of interest for life ,-1
i feel my life very messed up i see my dreams dying my life taking the wrong direction from what i imagined one day ,-1
why i ve never been able to feel whole ,0
my heart feels torn apart today ,0
today i came to work so discouraged i see so much stuff to do but i don t the motivation i feel angry when i think that i try very hard to do my best at this company and people indirectly disturb my work ,-1
in home things are going from bad to worse the situation with my brother and my sister in law are still the same causing a huge pain to my family ,-1
i wonder what they are waiting for to split up and get over with this suffering once for all ,-1
it s weird the way that i still think about him i want to call him ,-1
i was very childish the worst is that i still am i m not a little girl anymore i m a women now but there s things that i can t avoid ,-1
i see a lot of girls suffering for little boys that don t give a crap about them so to get attention they pretend to be something that they aren t ,-1
i think this is ridiculous understand if he doesn t like you now it doesn t even help besides it can help if you have a big ass and a big set of boobs he can think about getting interested in you ,0
but it doesn t help either putting a huge cleavage and a short shoved up in your ass girls like that will only been seen like a sexual object ,0
i did a research with some boys and they said that is normal for girls talking slang but saying too much is weird ,-1
the deal is don t stay behind him i know it s hard to not show what you are feeling but you can be sure they don t give enough value to girls that stay on them all the time ,1
if he starts a conversation it means that he likes to talk to you but when you start the conversation and he answer you with short phrases or takes a long time to respond and come with excuses apologizing for the delay it means that you are annoying him and he only responds from education ,0
before sending first see how was the goal between the two by the day ,0
when you see him give him some looks but without any disguise at the beginning he won t understand but face him for 1 second and after that move your hair softly looking in another direction,1
then he will try to figure out what you want ,0
many girls want to call attention from guys laughing or talking very loud this is something that little girls without attitude do and you don t want to be seen like this right ,1
post phrases like a detached girl that doesn t need any man to be happy ,1
 when the phone rings my heart beats faster already ,0
loving you while watching the sunrise in the morning ,1
but you know it s weird to think that this is natural i feel so bad for him showing interest for others i consider it so disrespectful ,-1
 secretly looking to another beautiful woman it s natural what woman doesn t know that a cute guy walked by her also ,1
but the point is showing interest for another person letting show that you re looking staring ,1
saying that life is made of choices is extreamely easy ,1
making the right choices is the hard thing ,0
at 27 years i picture myself still studying something that interests me if it s necessary studying everything all over again i picture myself with a respectful graduation scroll in my hands i picture myself having been through the best and funiest moments in life,1
 i picture mysellf visiting my family on the weekends and listening to the silly things that my father says and always will ,1
i picture myself thinking about children after all i have a dream adopting,0
i picture myself passing by my parent s house and leaving there warm bread in the afternoon ,1
 i picture myself at peace with myself with everything i ve done in life ,1
i ve never got dressed so quickly good thing i live 5 minutes by car from work,1
today my friend luciano embarrassed me big time ,-1
there s a healthy station close to our school and i asked him to pick up some condoms there for me because even beeing a girl i think it s good to have stored in case i have sex with someone ,1
i had to go to the lottery house to pay some bills because i let everything to last minute and the line was looking like a snail ,0
it took one hour but i did it i catched my bus with a terrible traffic ,-1
i ve worked the whole day on my birthday it s almost 8pm and i m still in this terrible traffic i m going to be home only for sleep today is my day and i didn t enjoyed anything,0
it was perfect my sister and my husband did it all two types of cake everything beautiful ,1
thank you my lord for the life of my husband ,1
like that you kissing me nicely and doing it all between four walls ,1
today me and my boyfriend had so much fun ,1
we were at the bus station and we played like in the movies he would chase me grabbed me by the waist tickled me held me in his lap lifting my feet from the ground ,1
it was so good forget about all my problems for a moment ,0
on saturday i went to the salon to do a brazilian blowout finaly good hair and no bad hair i could t take that straw anymore ,0
always at night i m scared terrified and never sleep in the dark i have a small light here that stays up on my wedding night i wanna do it in clarity ,-1
today i went to bed at 9 am because i slept at my boyfriend s house without my parents knowing,0
 i had to comeback home very early like i went to the club but at the end nothing happened ,0
 i had to comeback home very early like i went to the club but at the end nothing happened ,0
i took advantage of having already waken up and called my boyfriend because we were going to see each other again ,1
it turned out i met a person i love and she loves me too ,1
i m seriously thinking about running away from home and give a break and right after that live with my beloved ,0
i thought i would never love someone in my life and this happens now after i m already old ,1
oh my god i m so anxious i picture me and my beloved together all the time ,0
my husband in ten years can t put anything inside the house the bills are late the fridge is empty he s lazy ,-1
i recorded a movie on tv and now i feel like watching it ,0
 the story is about three fat girl friends that one day get sick of being how they are get sick of other people s looks of amusement get sick of not being able to do what other women do they get sick of being the badochas ,-1
so they decide to make an impact the cinderella impact where they make a promise to each other to do everything to lose weight ,0
and they make it lose weight and become women with a perfectly normal weight and way more beautiful ,1
 but this from now on will change because from now on i will give my best i will be able to make a healthy diet to lose weight ,1
i will prove to everybody that like the other girls i also can have an athletic body and be super skinny and perfect ,1
because i will be able to lose weight i will prove to everybody that i m not just any fat little woman ,-1
we already hang out and this is the third time i will be reporting ,0
we had already scheduled by cellphone on sunday ,0
on monday there would be a delicious sex in bed ,1
well we work at the same company but in different sectors she is blond long hair very hot ,1
we scheduled something and she was waiting for me in the parking lot ,0
we left and went at working hours to a motel called beira rio next to work ,0
we got there and went to a stand suite super comfortable and there started delicious kisses all over my neck and right away i realized she was burning up ,1
i took off my pants and stayed only with my gray boxy underwear and a black tshirt she went to the bathroom and came back with a killer red lingerie ,-1
sat on top of me and rubbed herself all over me deliciously ,1
but being alone is absolutely the opposite of being with someone ,-1
being lonely is closing your hands when crossing the street and having no hand to hold ,-1
being lonely is sad piss off others and is probably bad for health ,-1
i found out with my mom that my step dad was cheating on her ,-1
i also found out that he was cheating my mom with my aunt ,-1
and on top of that he beaten up my mom,-1
he threatened me said he was going to kill me ,-1
 i m still not able to stop cutting myself i now this is a problem and everything but it s been hard ,-1
sometimes it hits me that nobody likes me my mom is so annoying the only person that is saved and i haven t done anything stupid because he would t let me is vinny ,-1
sometimes i feel sad i m 12 years old and i never kissed before mostly of my friends have kissed even with their tongues and the worst part is that i feel ugly,-1
i never loved anyone like i loved you ,1
we re living in a world where the phisical apperance is more worthy than inner appearance ,0
before taking the history test we would say this prayer and i still pray these days it s been already three years since i haven t seen the teacher who taught us this prayer but i still really like her ,0
true friendships is what the world needs ,1
today was a day full of surprises and joy i don t know how to explain because i still can t believe that i m awake thinking about him at 5 am,1
he told he loved me and missed me and when he come for me after he was done with college ,0
 i came here after the light was back i kept looking the picture i have of him ,0
i don t know what i m feeling now but i feel peace joy but i don t know ,1
he completes you when you feel there s something missing inside you but you never knew what it was and then you find someone that gets you and is kind of the opposite from you and you feel complete ,0
look i m not really tall but enough for my age and under my ideal weight ,1
every time the school does tracking i m always allert because i m bellow it and i don t like that ,0
when i try to warn the closest people to you they say that i m skinny and must gain weight but when i try to play with the situation to warn them they say oh but you aren t tall either ,-1
after boys like girls with body not the ones who look like have just bones ,0
i don t have siblings and for many reasons i ve learned that my best friends don t know how to keep a secret ,1
i seem to have a very happy air because i ve learned that crying doesn t solve anything and this led to everyone trusting things to me because they know that i m very positive and safe ,1
the person who dated and never missed an ex cast the first stone ,-1
when we re in love there s a mess of feelings inside us that get us lost ,-1
i ve dated a boy called luan he is 3 months younger than i and maybe started this way was my mistake because women matures early than men,-1
but we had a perfect relationship it made everyone envy ,0
his friends started to hate me because he would only want to stay with me ,-1
we would just care about our opinions and dated for 9 months,1
one day we had a fight and i couldn t take it so i break up ,-1
after that we hooked up sometimes hiding so no one could disturb us ,-1
but i couldn t handle it be treated as a friend in front of others and after when we were alone have any kind of touch ,0
be aware boy she laughts from your most stupid jokes ,1
she has interest in all of your conversations that doesn t make any sense ,1
so she s there to stand you speaking about random stuff she just want to see your mouth move and listen the sound of your voice ,0
she doesn t mind hearing your complainings about love even still it hurts a lot she will always be there to support you ,0
she only cares about seeing you well ,1
when she makes you lose your temper don t fight she just like to see you a little annoyed because she knows that afterwards you will open a smile and she loves that smile ,-1
i see that i m surrounded by fake people and mens that are dirty and liars when i think that i ve encountered someone different i m wrong it s just another fake and liar ,-1
i m gonna learn how to live without you and if it is god s will i m going to be happy too ,1
i m always going to remember with care about all the thing i ve lived with you ,1
zootechnicians are professionals responsable for the studying and control of the reproduction genetic improvements and nutrition of animals created with comercial goals and look for increase the production and the quality of the products from animal origin ,1
they do experiments with feeding and research ways to guarantee the conditions of higene and also prevent and combat diseases and parasites ,0
they work also as rural administrators and planners of farms and rural installations ,0
eggs without collesterol and light pig meat are examples of what genetic research in animals can do for the search of more healthy food ,1
a lot of times confused with the veterinarian the zootechnician is actually the professional that takes care of the development of the production ,0
you traveled you are away from me ,0
i can t stop thinking about you ,0
well i don t know if i m gonna handle how much i miss you ,0
oh honey you are my other half ,0
i kill time writing in this online journal ,-1
i m excited waiting for you ,1
only you makes me smile ,1
i want your strong hug soon ,1
is it just me that didn t had a perfect and cute boyfriend not even for a month ,1
on my love life everything is a big shit ,0
when the guy is interested in me sometimes i m not into him or everyone is interested and it doesn t work something happens and that s it ,1
i know i should wait but i ve waited too long ,0
this is the first register that i do here and at the moment there is nothing much to talk about off my personal life so i m gonna say something that i wrote in a message ,0
stay there that i stay here with my breasts with hard and salient nipples waiting to be licked from top to bottom from a side to the other to be bitten softly and sucked for complete ,-1
nipples that can be soft as the breast that are swollen and proud to be so cute ,1
these breasts that doesn t fit inside one hand that flows between the fingers that twist to hold them with firmness fingers that go by the bra showing off through the cleavage of the red shirt and from inside the bra squeeze them with sweetness gently groping and pushing off all of the things that inside burns and throbs hard ,1
mouth that is soft greedy hot that will try to swallow all of him and will fail will lick it completely to make up the fact that can t touch it all with the mouth ,-1
the hands involving them while the mouth lick them like it was ice cream because they almost melt on the mouth ,0
and those nipples get harder and harder provoking an impatient and kinda nervous excitation that makes you wet off so much anxiety ,-1
my heart races my hands get colder and shaky i have butterflies in my stomach and a weird feeling when he is around mostly when we are alone or even in the crowd when he hug me and say you look beautiful today ,-1
on this moment i feel embarrassed and shyness take over me and when i realize i m in your arms ,-1
i forget totally about where i am and i stop caring about people around me when i m with him it s like just us existed there ,1
i think that live a romance it s a lot cooler than just a fling ,1
romance is for an undetermined time while flings have expiration date ,1
i m enjoying loving someon and being loved being corresponded with good feelings is the best thing ever ,1
may it be eternal while it lasts and may it last forever ,0
i m completely in love with you and i wish you all the good feelings all the good company ,1
may the love for the next and the will of knowledge be your mark on this beautiful shiny spirit ,1
may you bring with you the love the wisdom the peace the calm and the spirit of justice ,1
may you teach me to be more human and the true meaning of love first i want to say that i m sorry but may this beautiful opportunity be enjoyed and may god help us day by day to be mother and son may come my loved son ,1
i remember so many moments so many good things that we did together you ve been an angel to me ,1
i don t even remember well how i ve met you but i know that was the best day of my life you are more than a friend for me you are a sister from a different family ,1
you don t know how much i ve been sad about you changing schools ,-1
i want you to go well on life and love someone that loves you back ,1
we re starting to get away from each other and you don t even noticed ,0
but know that i miss you very much i miss your smile ,-1
dude i can t handle douglas anymore annoying boy ,-1
like he went away for some time but now he is back mocking me again ,-1
i don t treat him badly but man he just talks shit i ve already said that i don t wanna stay with him anymore but he insists in a way that suffocates me ,-1
i wish to have his friendship but he always comes with second intentions i m almost putting an end to it in other sayings excluding him ,0
and like i ve got sick of him and i don t even know why ,-1
he stuck his tongue so down on my throat that i almost died,0
i feel sick only thinking about us making out ,-1
today i went out with some friends ,0
i love them because they are very cool and funny we love to laugh and make jokes ,1
on our way to this girl s house we found an old man lying on the floor like it was dead or passed the weird thing was that the man was with his eyes half open and turned up ,-1
i thought it was super weird and got really scared but anyway we passed by the man and kept walking ,-1
my girl senses were telling me that something was wrong so i asked lucas and victor to went back there with me and try to wake the man up so we could now if he was alive ,-1
but i wanted to get back anyway so we went ,0
the boys were trying to wake the man up in every way possible and nothing so i decided myself to wake the guy ,0
i moved him bounced him and he doesn t woke up until i saw a bottle near his head so i decided to drop the liquid that was inside at his head only then he woke up ,0
my mom had a huge fight with me because of my sleep time ,-1
then the crybaby here spent the whole night crying until my eyes were swollen ,-1
i was thinking that the only way for my parents stop fighting with me would be me dying that way i wouldn t bother anyone ,-1
i had another antidepressant usually i just take two and went to listen some music ,0
after some time i was happily dancing like nothing was going on ,1
and it went that way since 5am when i finally decided to go sleep,0
and no it wasn t the medicine because he takes a long time to get effect it s not suddenly like that ,0
well the important is that i m better ,1
today i scheduled an appointment with the gynecologist ,0
we ve never had sex but i think is getting closer than far away ,0
i m virgin or at lest never had penetration ,0
the only thing that we did was oral sex he on me ,0
sometimes i geel kinda bad for beeing so dependent from others like i can t do anything by myself ,-1
i envy my friends that get everything done by themselves they know how to go everywhere and chilling ,-1
the university schedule was terrible ,-1
she keeps throwing at my face that i don t know how to do anything then i keep this in my head and it keeps me more and more impotent ,0
i fought with him and deleted everything but on the week after i saw more and more porn cartoons ,-1
so guys i don t like this i don t know i think it s a lack of respect with me ,1
but she s very special and my best friend ,1
with my finals at college i was devastaded ,0
it was seminars exams and papers altogether i was about to get really mad especially me who hates speaking in public ,-1
i don t have skills for it i stutter forget about what i m suposed to say and shit ,-1
there was a class that i hitted the limit of faults another one i passed by a hair there was a paper that i don t even saw the color of it but they wrote my name on it on seminars i was always saved by others ,-1
there was one that by the time of delivering i gave up and started to cry but i spoke with the teacher and she gave me an enormous alternative paper so i don t fail ,-1
i feel super bad about everyone presenting well and me presenting bad ,0
because it s public the level is very up ,0
and my inferiority complex just increase on this cases ,-1
my psychologist asked me if i wanted a second opinion for both the medication and if i really had borderline personality and i agreed ,1
i went to the psychiatrist and she gave me risperidone ,0
i ve decided to take it because i was really terrible i m still am but at least now that i entered vacation i m getting some relief ,0
i ve always been very perfectionist i like to always give the best of me specially at intellectual performance ,1
i want to compensate what my college friends did for me ,0
sooner no one will want to call me to the groups if i stay bad like that ,-1
i want to drive a car be independent be a successful psychologist ,1
at least the classes at college will be nicer and more adjusted with the course ,1
saturday july 28th was a wonderful saturday,1
i ve met a bot kind good looking and funny ,1
maybe i ve met him like two or more weeks ago i don t remember ,0
but i remember clearly that he told me that liked me very much ,1
don t be surprised it s nothing ,1
i was used to this for knowing that a lot of boys have already declared to me ,0
the worst is that i liked him too ,0
you can think that i m crazy i ve liked a boy that i met on the internet ,0
i m done chasing who don t deserve it now come after me if you want to you know where to look for me and where to find me ,0
they don t think like girls so don t treat them like girlfriends ,1
men are naturally territorial jealous and hunters ,-1
it was just blink my eyes that i ve fallen in love and in the middle of the smoke he liked me too ,1
yes i m a preppy ,0
yes i m a proud one i don t hook up with everyone this is a bitch move i play ball speak with the ones who want to speak with me and i m not about having much grilfriends ,1
my school is full of rockers and the preppys that went there normally became some bitches ,-1
i m one of the only preppy s at has some respect that likes reading and are not examples of whores ,1
last carnival there was a celebration at school all the classes went together i chosed to read a book at the library were there also the music teacher and some students that were also rockers ,0
i went in asked permission and grabbed a romance ,1
there was a boy that was looking at me in the eyes and this was bothering me ,-1
i don t consider myself a lucky person ,1
i also don t consider myself a person with feelings ,0
but the biggest of them is the hate ,-1
a lot of people think that i m wrong that i m saying a bunch of nonsense when i say that there s a huge amount of hate in me ,-1
but those persons are just mortals that speak what goes on their minds litterally they don t know nothing about me and even less about what i think ,0
not that i consider myself a imortal for me everyone has the same destiny ,0
but recently some strange things have happened to me ,-1
my family never cared about what happened and what did not happen to me ,1
besides no one never cared at least about how i was or if i was needing help ,1
no one never cared about me ,1
love letters usually don t start like this with explanations and motives ,1
but i wouldn t have other way to write something that i m feeling without trying to explain or give motives even that loving don t need any explanation and don t require motive to happen ,1
i think that love comes from nowhere grows like no one knows how and hurts without wanting to you may be my only hope or the last one ,1
it s not that i coudn t fall in love again it s because every time that i ll desire someone that person will be you ,1
you are different about the one who will be in my dreams ,0
you are the only one responsable about what i m feeling i give myself completely to you if you want to i can give your name to a star or give the star to you ,0
i can try stopping the wind or sit at the spring breeze i can try to make the sun stop or try to make your day perfect i can try to do so many things to you but i can t make you love me like i love you ,1
well if loving you is thinking about you 24 7 going out thinking about crossing paths with you at any moment close my eyes and see your face could be love,1
and every day i ll look to the sky and will be thankful for finding you and for you beeing more than i would hope to i ll thank for your eyes ,1
on this terrible state of depression that i was into i didn t knew what else to do from so much despair i felt a pain that was heartbroken hurted a lot more than anything or almost anything ,-1
i ve found a solution or better in my head it was the only solution ,1
i started to cut my wrists to forget about my emotional pain with physical pain ,-1
as incredible as it seems that would make me stronger ,1
my friend laura the dumbest of all started to cut herself on the middle of the classroom ,-1
motherfucker again she was called at the director s office gave the name of all the players in the game and every one of them were called to a conversation like it was in a police department ,0
so they found out that all of us had been huting ourselves they though that we ve did some kind of pact they called our parents but only laura s and my mom that went there and got the notice ,1
my weekend was average let s say that i was hoping for a little more ,1
last night my boyfriend went here we didn t went out we stayed at the house ,0
and as usual another couple s fight ,-1
 but this time it went nice we ve talked a lot i think he understood my side ,1
actually i think i ve sorted to show in a clearer way what i was feeling ,0
it was cool after many talking we kept kissing it s amazing how that boy has the gift to make me crazy and at the same time makes me happy ,1
the moments by your side were always so perfect you know ,1
when you kiss me it s like millions of lights shined at my world i feel like floating in your arms ,1
when you hug me i feel protected ,1
like no external problem could affect us ,-1
i m sure this is called love ,1
and it is amazing how this feeling makes me good and bad at the same time ,1
today i ve felt very lonely but instead of crying like always i self harmed ,-1
i hit myself a lot and bite myself 3 times,0
i don t recomend this to anyone but i can t think about something else when i m sad because my friends and family don t understand that i get sad without a motive and they will call me stupid and if i tell somebody that i ve self harmed people will call me sick because that s the human being judge one another ,-1
life was given to us freely ,1
the power of reaction is inside every one of us ,0
there is no magic potion to be happy ,1
it s only required that you have a clean soul without sorrows and grudges ,-1
each one is free to complete your mission as their wish ,1
happiness is at the door just open and invite her in ,1
we ll always have good souls lending us a hand ,1
alive happy and comunicative these geminians beeings light and relaxed they always look like their well with everyone ,1
friendly like them they will always give the impression that are interested in someone but they are just talking and searching for information ,1
the geminis are always very expressive and talk a lot with their hands always telling things that happened very lively ,1
their walk is kind of cheerful and joyful and they are always doing a lot of things at the same time like studying while watching tv and talking in the phone while talking to you ,1
the reality is that they are not following the fashion they are the fashion ,0
i m very organized paranoid i m disgusted about almost everything ,-1
i love children and sometimes i really look like them i love to play jump well mess i love different and happy things,1
the truth is that i m too intense and there is no one who can fix it ,1
i cheer with happy things that are not mine ,1
 the good in everything is that every night before bed i pray ,1
and i always smile ,1
the longing is the biggest proof that the past worth it ,-1
truly i don t have energy to dress to take care of me the bad thoughts take over my head and i turn desperate ,1
 i lent money to my father and honestly i really regret it ,0
diego sent me away didn t wanna know about me anymore my mom turned her back on me i had just my dad and he was asking for me to take the money out of the bank making a huge pressure on in and i wouldn t take it out ,-1
to be real now is not different because he is with me out of pity ,-1
now i m here with all my credic card bills having to be negociated i m going to pay triple the value because of fees without a penny and to make better diego fighting with me and throwing at my face every day that i m dumb for lending money to my dad ,0
he doesn t get it because he never had to deal with this kind of trouble but i m sure that if was his father or mother he would do the same thing ,1
diego instead of being a present boyfriend that supports me give me advice try to understand my side and help me only judges me and fights with me about it ,0
yesterday i was with my best friend in the classroom i got in late and talked a little bit with my best friend ,1
so that crazy one that i talked about the other day arrived the day where i was embarrassed and she didn t let me talk with my best friend ,-1
then the crazy woman talked to her and i didn t even understand the conversation but ended up quiet ,-1
 the portuguese class was boring ,-1
the hours passed by we went to the video room it was gym class shit ,-1
i wanted to go to the gym but the teacher wanted us to stay in the video room and watch the boring movie ,-1
you promised me i know i remember you swore it would be forever,1
you ve promised too that would forgive my mistakes and my flaws every slip that i did have you would forgive because the good that i ve made to you overwhelms any pain ,1
forgive me i ve made mistakes that are unforgivable i ve done exaggerated slips and it was not the first time i ve lied by fear of your reaction by fear that you would left me i fought so much side by side with this fear that nothing helped the fear only made me lost you ,-1
i can t hide the sadness and the tears already took over my eyes ,-1
 i have no ground no aim no dreams ,0
 i find myself empty hopeless and after everything i ve done you with no courage to ask you to stay with me ,-1
i love you so much i wanted you to know that to realize all of my acts of love care and dedication that i ve shown you ,1
 i think about the future because this is going to be good for me and for everybody i love ,1
i m going to graduate get to work and will do everything to bring peace to my home ,1
i don t intend to commit to anyone ,0
we think differently we have different goals ,0
i come from a family where my dad always supported financially the house to raise the kids while my mom stayed at home taking care of us ,1
we didn t have everything but the essencial to become responsible adults ,0
i have lots of friends i m an extrovert person happy i love to see people happy around me i take care of my health because if we have that the rest we can work it out ,1
 but my husband is a metirialistic bad tempered almost bipolar yes a good father but not a good husband ,1
he doesn t have many friends and sometimes he is too selfish if he needs he would step over someone to win something ,0
to me the simplest things in life are the best i love visits ,1
 and making someone happy is worth more than knowing my own life ,1
 i m really happy with the acceptance even though i know it wasn t really deserving ,1
but this time it ended well after so mmany pain and suffering for the circumstances everything went fine ,0
and this had affected me a lot i was totally angry ,-1
i still remember of your sweet words to me ,1
i remember about the smile you opened when you saw me about the explanations that you gave when you couldn t make a phone call ,1
 i still remember when you looked at me and told me how much you loved me how much you wanted me ,1
i still remember when you looked at me and said you were afraid of losing me ,-1
 i still remember how satisfied i was to see you smile ,1
i still remember everything that i lived with you and i miss those nights where you would tell me your joys and agonys ,0
 i ve been remembering of those conversations our laughs and also of our secrets ,1
 i always recall your smile when i was sad i would feel embraced by it ,0
and i remember as well about how you could appease my pain ,0
i wish that i could go back in time have you by my side with your enlightened eyes ,0
i kept them all in my memory i will never forget ,0
our paths changed but weren t lost i m still here and the best of all i m sure you re still here too ,1
if you need you can reach me if you miss me call if you are in any kind of trouble count on me and if you have time let s see each other ,-1
i don t have that young look anymore but my heart still is the same one that loved you that gave you kindness and loved to get it from you ,1
we might see each other tomorrow we might see each other a year from now we might grow apart even more but i want you to know that today i remembered you ,0
i promise to love you until the end of my life until my last breath until my last heartbeat until the last tear in my face ,1
because now i know that it s you that my heart choose that it s you who i m gonna fight for until the infinite and will wish in every moment in every desire of every pray that i ll do ,0
i feel this desire every day you know even when i do it hours after i m already horny to make love ,1
my guardian angel is called douglas besides being beautiful he s also my best friend ,1
because friends say i love you too ,1
i can t think about him without laughing ,1
he would call every boy that i talked about beeing my friend idiot he wasn t a boring friend that would stay on your foot but he never let me do anything wrong ,-1
he was and always will be my best friend because he is not visible but still alive in my heart ,1
this is a place of many outbursts and i feel like i m the mom of a bunch of the girls who writes here because i m older than the most part here ,0
most people that threaten doing don t do it but if you re thinking i have a report to give ,-1
i friend of mine killed herself before 30,-1
it was scary to many people ,-1
separated from her husband and coudn t bear no more ,0
at 5 years old i almost died,0
i had appendicitis with serious complications ,-1
the truth is that it s a miracle that i m alive ,1
 and it would be really selfish of you to let the others solve it ,-1
i can t see a hot blonde in front of me that i get turned on fast ,0
 so i don t know what to do anymore give myself to death or wait a little bit longer ,0
 hint dropping messes with my bad mood and just makes you more repugnant to me ,-1
me and my boyfriend have spend a lot of time together now and we still have that dream of sleeping together and waking up right next to each other you know ,0
 and still fucks you bad and after lick the lips of goodness ,-1
everything was so intense a month felt like a year ,0
after a lot of tears and a farewell party my vacations are over i came back to my reality and my summer romance was over because of the responsabilities from the real world ,1
i feel like there is a part of me in other place ,0
looking forward to a tight hug and a kiss on the forehead ,1
my mind says it s crazy to wait for so long but my heart says it s possible ,-1
today i ve missed nicely all the places where i stayed ,0
almost two months made me have a routine a very crazy one but a cool one ,0
i believe that it was because of this that this vacations were perfect ,1
it was a gift from the sky ,0
traveling with friends without any family around was the best thing ever ,1
now i m missing this freedom a lot ,0
this story is about a relationship between women ,0
i woke up late wanting really bad to stay in bed to do nothing simply vegetate ,-1
i hate feeling lazy i blame myself about not enjoying the world when i stay doing nothing but i ve been feeling a great desire to sleep and to forget the world around me for the last weeks ,0
the car that i wanted to buy will have to wait i didn t knew that stuff for houses were so expensive everything looked like a dream or a nightmare to be more accurate ,-1
arriving there helen welcomed me with a smile but something on her eyes were different she said to me that erika was there with some friends dismounting some furniture ,1
 as soon as you get up there erika will look at you with those reprovation eyes ,0
when the night came we drove to the nearest hotel to the house with a good appearance so i would be more confortable to spend the night ,1
we went up the stairs and entered room 42 a mirror in the front huge bathroom with old ceramics on the room a huge bed it had a motel vibe but less bold,1
she went taking her blouse going to the bathroom i was staring her curves she wasn t too skinny but she was not overweighted either when i heard the shower on i started to feel my body warmer i knew that it was the first symptoms of excitation ,1
i entered the bathroom and went taking my clothes off looking at her eyes i asked if i could come in she nodded the head with a malicious smile and gesticulate yes and ran her hand over my body ,1
we woke up pretty early and went back to her place soon the truck would arrive for the moving i had taken a big responsability ,1
seeing all that baggage put together i realized that what i was doing was really a madness that i was starting to enjoy ,1
i ve already loved someone who never love me i did all that i could do for my ex and suddenly she left me it hurts badly loving and living from crumbs and in my short life i ve already suffered a lot so why not respond to helen ,0
why not making her happy since she s willing to make me happy ,1
now with a more open heart headed to the new home with the truck after 30 minutes we were close,0
life was rough for me since i was little working as a shoeshine starving and watching everyone with parents while i was an orphan with alive parents ,0
i realized that almost no sun would come in and the biggest challenge was clothes i noticed that helen was not happy but knew that i would help her my money was short she got her name dirty and were surrounded in bills she would not be able to help me too soon ,1
we barely started and the money issues began ,0
maturity knocked at my door early i had to put food on the table early ,0
while i have strenght i fight i think that s why i got a good job early i have good social skills of course that the beauty of a descendant of indian with italian makes a difference ,1
on that night i slept with her the fights at my house were constant i couldn t go to class i was far from my family and to help that my mom and i were fighting a lot ,-1
i went back living with her when i was 11 it was when my aunt abandoned me our relationship was very hard she repeat millions of times that i wasn t her daughter that i was a mistake that happened,-1
until i couldn t take it anymore and started to confront her i left the house without a destiny a lot of times and for the first time at the age of 12 i met depression,-1
 my mom used to call talking a lot saying that i was irresponsible and that thing shoudn t stay that way ,0
our first weekend arrived i went to buy food prepared lunch washed clothes everything was so good and she was so happy besides everyting she would said to me that she was happy and asked every day to marry her ,1
i only remember hearing the phone turn off i knew i had lost my family in that moment ,-1
that morning was torture i knew my mom would speak a lot she burns out out of nowhere and doesn t stop when she fights with my dad she almost beats him ,-1
this moment i felt my life ending my heart was broken into a billion pieces everything i ve conquered i lost everything i ve been i was no more the tears were running down my face ,-1
i felt angry to myself about dropping everything for another person about letting her speak to me like that speaking about her like that ,-1
i went back listening to her martyrdoms trying to hide my crying face but deep down i was more lost than a whore on a convent ,-1
the six o clock hand struck the taxi was wainting for me i entered the house again hoping everything was a dream ,1
i wanted to die i didn t knew how to say what i was feeling it was a mix of fear despair and a huge loneliness i ve always been lonely ,-1
 whoa you look so skinny and pretty let s go out to buy pants i always do that with your sister i think we can do it ,1
it was wonderful perfect for a moment i got the attention my sister had without effort ,1
now after three years i see myself by the bathroom i haven t done any effort just vomited like in the old times ,-1
i couldn t respond i didn t cry i didn t smile i just sitted by the bathroom floor looking to knowhere with an eternal feeling of godness in the middle of the void that was torturing me ,-1
i woke up with helen looking at me i knew that she wasn t ok but that moment she was the only one i had and i was the only person she had i took a shower dressed myself and went out ,1
everything is gonna be alright i will arrive early today and will make the pasta that you love do you wanna take something you fell asleep without eating anything ,1
during the day i could see my brother by the window a cute blonde boy we are a lot more than brothers we share secrets he is my accomplice and i m his ,1
then one more month went by didn t eat didn t live did nothing at all and at the end of the day puked helen would lock herself into the world of bills using my card she wasn t caring any longer ,0
my uncle is getting back from paran where the aunt that raised me lived he asked to talk to me about a subject very delicate ,1
the night was coming when i heard a knock on the door ,0
of course i came back from the trip because i would like to know how are you i bring bad news about your aunt ,-1
you ll always be that little girl with blonde hair and the cutest smile of the universe on the face i love you don t forget that ,1
i closed the door helen was looking me scared the tears were mixing with the water from the shower the door opens ,-1
i can t my life is over i don t know what to do ,0
on the week after it was raining a lot i woke up during the night scared the house was filled with water on the bed s height ,-1
after a few minutes helen came in a way that i ve never seen it was true it was a lot more than a simple sex ,1
after that experience every time that she wanted me to be a men in bed and after i started to question about why she was doing that ,0
two days after the flood i started to have strong muscular pain and the fever was not constant seven days had past i went to work with a giant eye i thought i had a pinkeye so i asked some days at work and when i was leaving i had a great surprise it was my sister looking at me ,1
my god that s why you look so red i think you have a fever but why wouldn t you go to the convention ,0
he gave me i big hug a kiss and told he loved me i smiled ,1
everybody in the room included my father stood up the worry was visible in everybody s faces ,-1
 i got to reconnect with my family and make helena reconnect too ,0
i have everything i tiny teenager could have friends people who love me money popularity i have everything ,1
i don t have the touch of your hand going through my body i don t have your arms i don t have your kisses i don t have you in my life ,1
i do everything i can because for my life to be perfect it only needs you in it ,1
well today i m embarrassed and hating myself a lot more ,-1
you know today when i was leaving my house s garage i accidentaly bumped the car and scratched it on the back i m feeling like garbage ,0
and my husband saw it and caught my attention with reason because i m very distracted and dumb for doing this and i admit that i m wrong and i m very embarrassed of him because i did that ,-1
i know it wasn t on purpose but i m obligated to pay more attention ,0
i want to beat myself up because of the amount of hate i have of myself ,-1
yesterday i had a wonderful night with my husband ,1
it s not going to be hard for me to write this guide ,0
when you fall in love for a shy girl you should know that she could be too but will never take the initiative not even to look you in the eyes ,0
so you are the one who needs to go there and talk to her anything normally say hi and after how are you doing and ask something interesting nothing too personal ,1
if the two of you end up liking the conversation probably that would be a sign that she s liking talking to you and thinks you are a nice person that s very important to all go well ,1
so in case you don t see each other anymore call her and ask her out so you two can talk ,0
she even can be a little akward but if the previous conversation went nice for her definetly she will accept the invitation ,1
don t be quiet during the date it will let her quiet too in case she wants to say something she could be embarrassed and stay quiet so keep engaging with good subjects ,1
when you go to ask her to be your girlfriend don t play the hard one because that don t work with shy girls be straight talk to her getting exactly to the important part ,1
after she finally accept all flushing here is a tip never let her feel pressured by you if someone makes a joke that could make her feel bad defend her imediately always engage good subjects i repeat ,1
 i m sorry for not always taking care of you little one ,0
i thought so many trivial things were more important ,0
i m sorry of making such a big and unforgivable mistake ,-1
i was such an idiot for appreciating things after losing,-1
but still i know that if i simply went to play with you like usual you would forget everything and would cheer me up like you ve always done ,1
do you remember that christmas that i ve spent alone ,-1
my dad chose my stepmother over me despite i ve been used to it it was the first time that would happened ,0
you were there to help me when i needed it ,0
you drank my tears and slept by my side all the times that i ve cried to sleep ,-1
on easter there we were on the same year alone by the house again ,-1
you were always there when i needed yes i feel like i should repeat this ,0
how many people really worth knowing and are true friends to you ,1
when my parents divorced i had nothing left ,0
i think that i was already mature to have eight or nine years ,0
only you knew that i didn t cried about beeing alone on those dates that we used to celebrate but i cried at night because my dad was all that i had and i was simply his second option ,-1
 then i have you left ,0
you were simply stolen from me right ,0
i knew you went missing somehow i wanted to avoid this i wanted to lie to myself ,-1
truth hurts always have ,0
after my dad simply came and talked something like you are heartless you didn t noticed that the dog it s not here anymore that he was stolen ,-1
even so that moment i searched for you ,0
i searched like never before ,0
i looked all over the backyard i went out wearing pijamas in the streets of curitiba looking for you ,0
at night i cried ,-1
i cried more than i cried at christmas and easter i swear i cried ,-1
i don t know how it s possible but i cried fot six hours non stop ,-1
it didn t made it better my dad seeing me crying and starting to scream stop crying that s childish and fight with me cursing me of everything ,-1
i simply thought can t he see that i just lost everything i had ,-1
i felt like the most groundless person in the world ,0
dog thank you for beeing there when i was suffering bullying and when i got anorexic because of the stupid comments that would not change anything about my life if i simply didn t care ,0
 thank you for being there when i thought about killing myself i looked at you and said i have to satay to take care of you ,1
nobody believes it and some even laught about it when i say that my dog was everything and nothing to me and that he saved me of suicide but i think that by reading this text some would understand ,1
i still spend every christmas since that one alone and easters too ,-1
 not by purpose the family simply forgets about my existence ,0
my mom even let me go out with her she takes my sister and after she even complaint that she s the unloved of the history ,-1
well on days like that i always miss you ,0
i regret of crying before having you by my side and now i feel that i have real reasons to be like that ,-1
thank you for changing my life and saved me ,1
honestly without you i would be already dead ,1
this is a phrase that i use to say to someone that asks about my life but no one gets it ,0
the ones where i explain myself are just a few ,0
it has to be for someone that really deserves the story and have the patience to listen it ,0
now i m supported by memories did you know that ,1
not having you anymore i think that s what s left for me ,0
i can t hold on to friends that i know won t be with me like they say they will ,1
i hold on to memories because a lot of them don t comeback a lot of people changed but memories did not ,0
 when a looked back he barked wagged his tail and made a sexy pose that seduced me i want him ,1
i don t know if you remember that dog but i do ,0
i don t know if you are alive but i know that whatever you may be you are in my heart and i m with you little one ,0
that promise i made you that christmas and hugged you tight,1
i still have your collar your food pot everything that belonged to you ,0
i don t even dare to throw anything away because that s what i have left of you is t it ,0
 maybe i ll donate to a dog in need of love ,1
it would be evil to one not have while i have and don t give because i m too attached ,-1
it s on the heart and soul and i know that you look for me little one ,0
the boyfriend is not mine ,0
well i ve wanted to talk about what i think about my friends boyfriend one of my closest friends ,1
i ve talked some things to her but it s complicated speaking about someone else s boyfriend right ,0
she dates for almost 4 years now already broke up once but for a little amount of time,-1
they live in different cities but close from each other ,0
and he doesn t care if her parents don t like it ,1
he doesn t care about nothing ,1
he s 20 didn t graduate high school for lazyness don t have a job and it s fanatic for going to the gym,0
everywhere they go the bill is always splitted equally between the two of them ,0
she can t enter the web when he s at her house unless it s very fast because she must be around him all the time ,0
she can t go out here without him just stay at home ,0
i ve never dated long distance but i think that it wouldn t be easy ,1
he turns off the cell by night and on the other day says that ran out of battery ,0
he goes out late night and say that is going to get a pastel ,0
the funny is that he almost never has money to spent with my friend always have to split the check but to spend with high brand clothes shoes and the gym he always has ,1
the funny is that he almost never has money to spent with my friend always have to split the check but to spend with high brand clothes shoes and the gym he always has ,1
she even said that he is super materialist and worries a lot with himself ,0
they don t trust each other she already said to me clearly that don t trust him ,1
last night when i arrived from the course and was about to get dinner i felt a regular pain that i feel on the leg but my leg got paralized fernanda took me to the living room where my dad was having dinner when i went to the living room i started to shake and feel a huge dizzy and a hum on my ear followed by numbness in the hands ,-1
nanda called the 911 but it didn t help much they couldn t come but my dad drove me to the hospital i was aswered quickly but the doctor didn t knew what i had and prescribed me a medicine to stop the shaking and it was venous so i would have to take with sour at my vein,-1
so there is the reason for my panic i couldn t take the medicine i was too nervous and scared my dad didn t get it the phobia that i have of needles and fought with me in front of the nurses ,-1
meu pai me segurou pelo bra o e queria me levar para tomar o rem dio a essa hora eu j estava em uma crise de p nico e n o conseguia parar de chorar e nem raciocinava mais ,0
when i went back home my dad lectured me my sister was the only one that understanded what i was feeling i cried almost the whole night ,-1
i ve suffered a lot for not beeing able to take the medication and suffered even more for the brutality of my parents for not understanding that people who suffers from phobias are not kidding ,-1
last night i fought with my older sister she s very boring and arrogant ,-1
yesterday she was at work and my cousin said that she had chocolate and i m crazy about chocolate ,-1
well today i start to write in my digital journal since i don t have a single friend to listen to me when i need it ,1
my name is edvania lemos i m married and i have a son with 12 years old,0
i got married pretty early and i don t think it was a good choice ,1
when we are young and fall in love we see everything like it is a fantasy filled with good things and we gave ourselves body and soul to the life that we think is perfect ,1
well my dilemma starts like that i had a boyfriend when i was 14 years old i stayed with him until i was 16 so i got pregnant and everything went down the hill,1
i had a lot of nausea and my boyfriend poor thing was the one whom i got more disgusted and with only 4 months of pregnancy each one of us went to our own path literally,-1
they were wonderful with me supported me and helped me in everything ,1
but because of my own conscience i ve decided to provide for my son by myself ,0
well when my son was 5 months old i met a friend to my sister at first was a friendship but with more or less 15 days we gave our first kiss and what a kiss it was passion for sure,1
he immediatly took over me and my son that was still a baby and it was all perfect ,1
he was too gentle and in love he took care of me and my son like a true men he took my son literally it looks like my son is really his biological son he is a perfect father like every one should be ,1
we dated until my son were 1 year old so we got married bought our house and started our life together,0
everything was fine he was from the army didn t made much but it was enought with 2 years of marriage we was promoted to sargent and of course everything went a lot better financially,1
the sex were not that good anymore and my husband went very quiet with me ,1
with our son he didn t changed a thing always had done his part as a great father and i can never complain about that ,0
one afternoon he went saying that he needed to go to a event at the station ,0
he was irritated because he wasn t happy going but he said that he must go ,0
me like the good wife that i ve always been prepared his best uniform shined his boots and left him all smelling good and beaultiful gave him a kiss and he went ,1
he arrived around midnight i was anxious waiting for him because we ve always slept clinging and because of that i was waiting for him ,-1
when he entered it was weird he went straight to the shower clean himself not even a kiss like usual i thought it was strange but we made love and went to sleep ,0
that happened at wednesday s night and on sunday i was preparing lunch and my husband was watching football with my son ,0
then someone clapped at our gate it would be there where my life falls apart it was a men and my husband went answer and he was pale and nervous i didn t understand why so i stayed at the door my disappointment and anguish were huge ,-1
hello who have never suffered from love or passion ,1
i think most people won t even answer just for passing for bad experiences with thoses ,0
there is so many good and bad situations involving love and passion that we can t describe them all ,1
i ve liked a boy for almost 3 years,1
by this time that is not short i ve had good and bad moments most of them were bad and it looks like i can t go out of this one ,-1
even when that someone gives you proof of how much he is not interested in you keep finding ways for trying to revert somehow ,1
when he makes clear that he doesn t like you you cry or get sad for some days but afterwards you think about some way to make him see how special you are ,-1
after had proof that this person don t want me again i ve decided that i m going to forget about him ,0
no one deserves to be humiliate themselves crying well suffering for a person that doesn t give value or don t want to recieve your feelings ,-1
this is the advice that i left for you value yourselfes every one have a soulmate ,1
my love and i were born for each other it s only missing the ones who are going to introduce ourselves ,0
i m upset and disappointed ,-1
my mom confessed to have prejudice towards my boyfriend that is black ,-1
i said to her that it doesn t make a difference to me but i feel that she don t support my relationship ,1
like everything was very well very cool ,1
i ve decided to cut my bangs ,-1
unless the fact that my stupid hairstylist had it wrong ,-1
and cutted my bangs to the middle of my forehead and it was not straight ,0
we put so much trust and feeling on people ,1
in people that we thought we knew but that in the end show us to be the same way than everyone else ,0
and for waiting too long dream too much create huge expectations we always endup beeing let down and getting hurt even more ,0
the attitude of a fool in love ,0
but i really thought that it was going to work that by opening my heart you would i dont know say that you felt the same i promised that i thought it would work like that ,1
in my dreams i ve imagined your mouth saying to me things that would make me happy that from that day it would be me and you forever e,1
but it didn t happened and today we aren t even friends a five year old friendship ended like that ,0
but between beeing your friend or a strange i rather by a thousand times be your friend i miss our conversations laughs jokes anyway i miss you in my life ,-1
i ve wanted to share with you about my relationship and tell you what others have already told me ,1
i met my boyfriend on my 19 birthday we took the same technical course on the same school and a friend in common introduced us,0
since i has already broken my face in another relationship well in almost all of them i didn t even care much but after i knew him a little bit more i started to like him ,1
currently i m 20 years old and he is turning 29 in april i prefer older guys i m happy with him and that s whats matter,1
once i had least than a month of relationship when my niece was born and my boyfriend went to the hospital to met her and part of my family which by the way loves him ,1
my mom took a picture of me with him with my niece and with our friend the one that introduce us and that work with him she s 42 years old,0
so my mom went home and i went to the course with my boyfriend and our friend when i came home my mom told me that posted the picture on her orkut page ,0
girl i ve just seen the picture from miih with her boyfriend on orkut don t take me wrong but he looks like it s a lot older than her ,-1
the person who posted this is 56 years old and was married at the time with a 24 year old,0
i got posessed ,0
i almost curse that woman from top to bottom it s so much lack of respect who is she to talk about my boyfriend ,0
nothing against it but people should see themselves more sometimes at least i think it should ,0
so the time had passed and i went to a federal college now i study at a private college it s a subject for another time and as soon as i get there i made friends at the class ,0
a coleague took my cellphone and saw a picture with my boyfriend ,0
my boyfriend don t look like it s much older than me but his kinda bothers me because in love age doesn t matter ,0
if he was 50 and i loved him i would stay with him without a problem,0
i get upset it s obvious that this kind of ridiculous comment don t affect my relationship but i think humans should be less indiscrete and have more consideration to the other ,-1
lately i fight with my mom everyday we fight about everything yesterday i was fighting with my youger sister bruna because she messed with my things ,-1
my mom said that i m very rebelious ,-1
but i think that is because i m becoming a teenager and everyone is like that on this phase ,0
5 years without the person that i care the most in this world,1
5 years ago i ve lost my motive my hope my reason to live,0
but unfortunately i don t have her and still alive so i need to live even without her ,-1
i stay for her and with her ,0
i love her more than anything in this life so i love my life ,1
i should raise my head and follow because i know that she wants it too that i follow my dreams that i become somebody ,0
and be sure of that mom i m gonna make you very proud ,1
you know that the boy who is gonna give you most value is the one who can t get to you the one who looks at you and when you notice turns his head down or smile that can t look you in the eye and talking to you makes him laugh like a fool and a lot of times ends up talking some nonsense but you know that he does that to get a smile out of yout face ,1
and because he is very shy to make a move on you it s shyness ,-1
you know that those boys who don t even say hi to you have the most truer words to say to you by your ears ,1
they just wait for the right day to say it an oportunity a chance ,0
so girl why you don t stop getting interested in the boys who come to you with courage talking about your looks looking at your body and complimenting you trying to get you for how you look outside ,1
because the same bot that has the courage to talk to you has the same courage to talk to another girl minutes after and repeat the same words just to get what he wants ,1
while the shy boy spend hours preparing something to say to you when he sees you and he stays remembering about your smile your eyes even your way of speaking every expression of yours ,0
the boy who don t have the courage to talk to you has admiring you for a log time by distance and knows you well more than you ever know and a lot more than the other who has attitude ,1
my friends discovered because they grabbed me using force and removed my jacket to see what i was hiding ,0

my day was good i woke up early helped my parents to set up my party went to pick my friends up ate a lot of barbecue and cake and we relaxed for a bit ,1
i ve called nando all day to check if he is coming to my party ,1

so i asked my mom to let us go to the movies she allowed we cutted the cake and went to the movies we went to see the avengers it was very cool ,1
i bought my book ,0
i went to look my cell phone as usual and saw a message there ,0
when i read this message i thought about calling him to check him out and try to advance what he wanted to talk to me ,0
we started the conversation and it was everything fine until he said that was going to get back just to see if he could get invalidated from work or so he could sign his resignation letter ,0
my heart broke in a million pieces i started to cry at the time he asked for me to not cry and said that was difficult for him too ,-1
he is just doing that because he can t deal with his mom anymore when they fighted she grabbed all of his clothes putted in a bag and screw him over ,-1
today i woke up and saw your side of the bed empty ,-1
your smell is still there somehow in my head ,0
i ve always closed the door and fought with you because it was open ,-1
now the window is always open like you used to asked me and i didn t even noticed it ,0
i fought with you about letting the tv turned on and a bunch of lights by the house ,-1
and now they are on and i didn t even noticed ,0
your side of closet is empty and i didn t even filled it ,-1
your side of the shoe rack was filled with shoes that didn t end and i always complained about the confusion ,-1
on the bathroom your drawer is empty ,-1
the window is not with your ten shampoos ,0
there is something extra in the closet and i don t know if it is yours ,0
it s a toothbrush for traveling my mom could have forgotten when she came to take her stuff away ,0
on my computer i have countless photos of yours ,0
i have countless photos of you with other people that i hate ,-1
i hate not because they did something to me but for the fact that you gave yourself to them ,-1
besides all the hate i miss you ,-1
when holiday comes or the weekend i count the hours to go to my parents house ,0
i m not looking for friends i m not looking for anyone actually,0
when i was with you you complained about not having time for family and friends ,-1
now i just simply don t complain about anything i stay quiet holding all of this inside me ,-1
i want to cry again ,-1
my eyes start to get filled with tears ,-1
before i met you i had a lot of friends,0
i left the house early and would come home pretty late when i returned ,1
i left by the world enjoying everything without time to end ,1
i didn t have fears ,-1
i ve had love achievements ,1
i did that because i didn t knew what love was ,1
she went out with her friends i went out with the boys ,0
i ve already made this question to myself and came back three times today the suffering is a thousand times bigger ,-1
this time i m gonna have to be strong ,1
i m not a person of telling dreams or facts but since it was an experience out of proportions i m letting go ,0
i m having a relationship with a person from my work yes we work at the same company but in different places decribing him is talking about a tall men with a voice that makes you wet yes it s a voice that don t need introduction ,0
his body is an absurd makes you want more and more his smile is hot just as it s owner ,1
we weren t talking for a few days when he calls me asking if i had forgotten about him and because i ve disappeared ,0
we went to meet but we were hungry for each other that i could feel his member in me while we were eating each other with kisses that were beautiful ,1
he moan in a way that made me very horny ,0
when he turned me over he kissed me so much that we started to cum together ,1
my body shaked more than his i stayed with loose legs ,-1
we showered together and when we started drying he throws me at the bed and made me moan with his mouth ,0
my head and my heart were so fast that i always waited for him to cum ,0
this time he made me cum in a way that my full body shaked ,-1
after 6 hours of pleasure we left the motel,1
but i was still in ecstasy ,1
i met a friend of my sister s the other day he s 17 years old and as far as i noticed it he is a player so i ve decided to study a little his species and i m going to help some of the girls in love reading that,1
oday will be the day where he will be completely and crazy in love with you if everything went good ,1
give all the love in the world to him without falling in temptation ,1
today i m very upset i think that i m beeing cheated my husband is treating me so cold ,-1
he already has cheated on me and i forgave him he is acting just like the other time treating me with the biggest cold ,0
i ve talked to my ex ,0
we just know about things living a lot of people judge ,0
the only one who really knows it s me who are living it feeling it ,0
he said that don t want me to left him don t want to see me alone ,-1
he said that really likes me and asked for me to have patience ,1
its for me to left when he left too ,0
the thing that i want the most is that my marriege work out living a intense love with him ,1
saying that i admire you that i like you is too little ,1
this friendship of ours deserves more than words it deserved to be tell to the world so everyone could feel and maybe understand the meaning of our friendship ,0
but lately i m not holding on it s like i need something more you know or better i need i need you ,1
what i m feeling about you is something that i can t even explain myself i ve tried to get involved with many i ve tried to forget you many ways but i can t it s stronger than me ,1
i didn t get not even a kiss but i can assure you that it was not necessary for me to fall in love madly for you ,1
i wanted to forget the light of your eyes because like that i wouldn t missed it i wanted to forget the sound of your voice your way of speaking i wanted to forget this beautiful smile that only you have ,1
i wished so much but i can t because what i m feeling for you is so strong impossible to forget ,1
but one thing is sure i love you a lot and even wanting to forget you i love you even more more today than yesterday more tomorrow than ever ,1
stay without you is getting the notion of time and not beeing able to fill it it s losing peace and met the absence of someone present ,0
waiting is painful forget is painful but not knowing what to do is the worst kind of feeling ,-1
i ve waited so long to get this far i don t know what to do anymore i fear losing your friendship but i believe i ve losted it because not even wanting me back you want anymore ,-1
although the fear of you getting away from me is bigger than everything ,-1
pay attention on the music i heard and the things i post ,0
on the way that i deal with you in how i care about you ,1
i really needed to tell you this i coudn t take it anymore ,0
when night comes bedtime i lay my head on the pillow and my thoughts leads me to a wonderfull world ,0
i think that i m on your arms shrinked and shy in love and realized ,0
i feel the strength and the warmness of the one who is the man of my life ,1
i dream with you all night long and feel bad and insecure for not knowing if one day i ll live this dream ,-1
don t be surprised with this confession ,1
it s indeed a bold declaration of love ,1
i don t want this to disturb you and take your peace away ,0
quite the opposite i would like to always be on your side to love you and give you a lot of affection ,1
i want all the quietness to you ,0
think about it be sure that i love you very much i wish yourconpany a lot ,1
i want to give you all my love ,1
fill you with kisses and fullfill all of your desires ,1
that s all that i had the courage to dream on the hope that someday i ll see my goal realized ,1
now you might know why i can t stand your little girlfriends because they always were with the boy that i really love and the one who i want to be with and always have been ,1
what i ve said could not matter at all because you have started a new relationship not too long ago but i really needed to express myself anyway ,0
and i hope you understand me because i didn t asked to be in love because who runs us is our heart ,1
sincerly you don t chose love it just happens ,1
coisas acontecem nos piores momentos faz parte dessa longa viagem chamada vida things happen on the worst times this belongs to this long journey called life ,-1
i woke up as usual around 6 20am to go to school i dressed up and went,0
arriving there i spoke with my friends and went to the hallway where i wait for my boyfriend everyday until 7 20 so he came stored his things and talked to me,0
he got closer to me gave me that very tight hug and said i love you ,1
he asked if i was better lately i ve only been crying i said to him that i was normal but i cant fool him he knew that i was not fine ,0
i had to hold myself on entering my classroom with my eyes filled with tears because the girls who said that are my friends would only want to know the reason for me to cry and critisize me about it ,-1
i spent 3 classes holding to not cry and trying to study because i was takling three tests after period,-1
with this 3 classes passing the break came i met my boyfriend again we left together and went to the courtyard sit in the same place that we sit everyday,0
i was dying to cry so i held my tears and said to him that i couldn t look at him because my eyes would start to tear up ,-1
it was complicated because i couldn t focus in other things what i wanted the most was finish those tests and go home to cry everything that i ve been holding ,-1
finishing the test i went down and met him at the courtyard he took the book from my hand and we went to the bustop when we got there we started talking ,0
i confess that i was really upset about this because i never forget him once over this past 10 months of relationship i always give something to him on this dates when i arrived home i went to cry a lot,-1
my boyfriend and i fought over the fone and i started to cry ,-1
i love him so much that i never want to lose him because he is the only reason of my smiles of my happiness ,1
we always say that we re not going to but falling for the wrong people without realizing it when we see we are aleady there without knowing the person first ,-1
giving too much believing and always suffering with it ,0
 we deliver our hearts our proud and all of our love ,1
how many times we have cried for a person that don t deserve a single tear we ran behind them and would not see the truth and a lot of times we don t want do see it because the truth hurts a lot ,0
when we find that someone that is very special and makes you smile forgeting about your past and makes you think about the present we can t stop thinking about that person we learn how to like the things that they like and do what they do just to say that we have a lot in common ,1
and when we wake up she is already on our minds we re missing them and dreaming high imagining the person in our lives ,-1
a lot of times that person hurt our feelings without knowing what we feel ,-1
the worst is when we get used to that person and she goes away without knowing that you are more in love each time that you can t picture your life without her and we say life moves on but she takes a part of us with her ,0
our heart is always the victm he always get broken in pieces ,0
he ran when the person come closer and beats harder because he thinks that this is your other half ,0
and when that person comes closer we tremble our hands get wet our world changes because the person is too special ,0
guys i would like to talk to you about my history with my family ,0
my mom was a single mom i didn t have a father ,0
she had 5 kids and no one had a father,0
she was always considered by relatives like nothing didn t had any money was sick and very unhappy ,-1
when i was 3 years old i went to live with an aunt because my mom didn t had money to raise me,0
this aunt besides giving me everything it was a devil she souted at me let other relatives abuse me sometimes hitted me putted me in ground in places where i was terrified anyway she was a witch false disgusting and bad ,-1
when i went back to my mom s with 13 years old my older sister was in a life of drugs and bad things she used to hit me frequently used my clothes and let dirty lended to her drugged friends and provoked me in a way that made me want to ran away from that hell,-1
when i thought that i would have peace my older brothers were very agressive they hitted because of everything they didn t hitted they spanked you my brother kicked me in the belly once that i was having my period for almost 10 days,1
i remember that i used to eat a lot in school so i wouldn t have to eat at home and i showered hiding it was very sad ,-1
until that with 15 years old i basically ran away from home and until now with 20 years old i didn t came back,0
i got help from someone to rent a house buy furniture beeing doing college and have an average life ,0
today i have a better financial condition than my family so they constantly wants to take advantage of what i have ,1
my mom only calls to ask for things to me she s not capable of come and visit me beeing present in my life when she comes by the house she just complaints about life so i can have pitty and give her money ,-1
my younger sister sucks i was helping her to pay for college and she was never capable of treating me with love and respect not at all in front of the aunt that raised me she wouldn t even say hi to me ,1
i m angry to think that even when i left their house i stayed helping them specially my mom and i never recieved love back sometimes i just couldn t handle the loneliness ,0
they don t like me don t believe in my potential of beeing a psychologist they don t give a penny on me to them i m the same than a rat ,0
god will put someone good in my life who will give me all the love that i need and when i built my family i ll have the support that i never get ,1
i respect animals a lot i ve learned that we shouldn t misstreat in any way the animals ,1
after she hugged me and said that everyone has the time of your life and that no one could know theirs ,1
but miracles exists i ve asked her ,0
the miracles exited because they didn t reconstructed on top of hiroshima again from the tears the blood the loneliness now it s a crowded harbour she said to me ,-1
when i told mom she was freaked out with fear of what she might think and wanted to know who told me and i said it was dad ,-1
i said to her that there s nothing to forgive ,1
mom was proud of me and said that i was an angel ,1
they decided to act in the most natural way ,0
but it s inevitable see the sadness on their eyes ,-1
i heard dad and mom talking last night at the room they said that every medical resource would be at my disposal as expensive as it was ,0
 i love them very much because they are taking awesome care for me ,1
while this doesn t happen i live my sweet life ,1
and i m done worring about others wanting always good for people around me and be named boring ,0
beeing good even when you are supposed to be boring try to treat everyone well ,1
two brothers that lived in near farms divided only by a river entered a conflict ,0
what began with a little missunderstanding exploded to a exchange of rispid words followed by a week of total silence ,0
one morning the oldest heard a knock at his door ,0
i m looking for a job maybe you have some jobs for me ,0
i think i understand the situation show me where are the shovel and the nails ,0
the older brother delivered the supplies and went to town ,0
the man stayed there cutting measuring working all day ,0
instead of a fence a bridge was built there connecting the two sides of the river ,0
it was a beaultiful job ,0
looking again to the bridge he saw his older brother getting close with arms open ,0
you really were a friend building this bridge even after everuthing i ve said to you so the older brother ran to the direction of the other one and they hugged ,1
the carpinter who did the job left with his toolbox ,0
have you think about how things could be easier if we stopped building fences and walls and started to build bridges with our families friends coleagues from work and more important our enemies ,1
love someone is very good and be loved it s even better ,1
i don t feel that love anymore i don t feel the pleasure i can t not even like me anymore ,1
sometimes i think about prawing in talking to god ,0
i have so many sins that i would have to born two times to ask for forgivness to god and regret of every single one of them ,-1
i stay commiting the same mistakes like something pushes me to the bottom to a deadend i miss affection getting ready to go out to go out to have friends to call i miss being someone that is remembered loved i feel lost ,-1
the beauty in a woman is in her smile personality and simplicity ,1
the true beauty of a woman is inside her ,1

i m in love with my best friend ,1
i just know that now i feel better and you know what suprised me the most the fact of these words had come from her ,1
it was god using the mouth of a friend of mine to transmit the message that he has something better for me ,1
thanks to show me through leticia that he wasn t the guy for me that in the future something better waits me ,1
i ve been recieving a lot of signals that he wasn t the one but didn t realized until now and only after that i realized that he wasn t my guy ,0

i ve always been very private about my masturbation life lets agree touching yourself is wonderfull but nobody goes telling everybody about it and i never had told any friend about it ,1
i was smiling for life didn t want something serious and he was getting me little by little with a very good talk ,1
he always talked about hot webcam calls i stayed on bra and panties once but that was some good months past ,1

he said to me in secret that you were the mouth that he enjoyed most kissing ,1
well since my last post were in august since then a lot of things happened and all this time withou posting anything was because my days were too fast but now i m going to try to have some frequency here ,1
there was nothing interesting in september i ve worked a lot like usual and it was close to the end of the year ,1
those last 3 months of the year are the ones in which we work more because we earn by comission,0
i mean i already knew her from sight we just said hello ,0
so time passed and she would walk in front of the store where i work and we looked each other ,0
until this october where she sent me a facebook invitation and i added her ,0
so my friend came to talk to me that she said that i was good looking and asked if i had a girlfriend ,1
i felt safe on her side i saw interest that would cheer me up ,1
i was kinda shy she went to hug me and gave me two kisses on the face ,1
on that moment i felt my body warm and a great feeling she was beautiful ,1
we spent 20 minutes talking before the movie starts and the conversation was good she would smimle touched me fixed her hair and blouse signals of interest from her,1
something nice very nice i was kissing her for the first time and it was very good for me ,1
i wanted to grab her boobs her tights kiss all of her body i was very horny ,1
she said to me that i was a very special guy that knew how to treat a woman like a queen ,1
but i m gonna have to learn how to live with this sometime ,0
because one thing is certain if it s not going to be with you it will be with someone who loves me ,1
today is my first day here i m loving it ,1
i fell in love for a guy from this site ,1
and that s how we met and become friends we were really friends without interest in nothing just friends ,1
we stayed seven days together and lived a beautiful love story like in the movies i still remember our first kiss in front of the see we even wrote our names at the abandoned trailer on the road ,1
we ve stayed together for 4 years and i loved him more than everything he was the first in my life for everything i didn t do nothing without him and we were always together,1
after that day i changed chaged my looks my wardrobe finished my studies and today i m a psychologist and i help women like me if i tell you that i forgot it wouldn t be true but i can rememeber it all without pain ,0
i met a new love we re together for 3 years and didn t came from a beautiful love story like the movies but we love each other and respect each other we give up a lot to make this right but we respect our limits and growned together we re getting married in december,1
my mom told me that one day when i had a great love i should fight for it and that s what i did ,1
